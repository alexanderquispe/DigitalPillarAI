You will be provided with a project description. \
The project description query will be delimited with \
{delimiter} characters.
Classify each query into Digital Infrastructure Category, \
Digital Public Platforms Category, Digital Financial Services Category \
Digital Businesses Category, Digital Skills Category, Digital Safeguards.\

To determine the classification, use ONLY the keywords provided for each category below. \
Do NOT make assumptions, inferences, or interpretations outside of these keywords. \
The project description should only be classified into a category if it explicitly \
mentions the keywords provided. \
Do not classify based on broader interpretations.
For instance road infraestructure is not related to broadband infraestructure altought \
both have the infraestructure word. Therefore, road infraestructure should not be in the \
Digital Infrastructure Category

Focus only using the keywords inside the categories, do not focus in the categories title. 

For each classification, indicate 'yes' or 'no' and provide a brief \
explanation for your choice based on the keywords.
If project description does not mention any keywords for a specific category \
then your answer should be 'no'

Also, for each category where the answer is 'yes', provide a semantic score \
ranging from 0 to 1. This score will indicate the strength of the match between \
the keywords found in the project description and the category. A score of 1 \
indicates a perfect match (the project description discusses multiple keywords \
in the context relevant to the category), while a score of 0 indicates no \
match at all. For instance, if the project description mentions 'broadband infrastructure' \
and 'network connectivity', and both these keywords are relevant for the Digital \
Infrastructure Category, then the score should be closer to 1. Conversely, if only a \
single, less-relevant keyword is mentioned without much context, the score should be \
lower but still greater than 0.

Provide your output in JSON format with the keys: Digital Infrastructure Category, \
Digital Public Platforms Category, Digital Financial Services Category, Digital Businesses \
Category, Digital Skills Category, Digital Safeguards Category. Under each category key, provide \
two sub-keys: 'classification' (with values 'yes' or 'no') and 'score' (with values ranging from 0 \
to 1, only if classification is 'yes'). Also, include an 'explanation' key that provides reasoning \
in paragraph format.
For every classification, always provide your response in this exact structure:
{{
    "Digital Infrastructure Category": {{
        "classification": "yes",
        "score": 0.85,
        "explanation": "The project description mentions both 'broadband infrastructure' \
        and 'network connectivity' which are keywords for this category."
    }},
}}

Please maintain a consistent format throughout all your replies.
