Türkiye is an upper-middle-income country with a strong record of inclusive growth, but recent shocks are threatening the economic gains made since the early 2000s. The economic recovery that started in late 2019 was undermined by the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered a deep economic shock that exacerbated the structural challenges Türkiye was experiencing before the pandemic. About 2.8 million jobs (mostly informal) were lost during the first wave of the pandemic, while labor market participation shrunk by 2.9 million workers over the same period.1 These challenges aggravated existing rates of youth unemployment, which rose from 20 percent in 2018 to 24.9 percent in 2020, before declining to 19.4 percent in 2022, and female labor force participation, which declined from 34.3 percent in 2019 to 30.8 percent in 2020, before increasing to 35.1 percent in 2022.2 COVID-19 also caused a significant setback in poverty reduction. Between 2018 and 2019, the share of people below the US$5.5 per capita per day (2011 purchasing power parity) poverty line rose from 8.5 percent to 10.2 percent, pushing about 1.5 million additional people into poverty. Another 1.6 million individuals were estimated to have fallen into poverty in 2020 due to the pandemic, before improving slightly in 2021. By 2021, Turkey’s economy exhibited a very strong recovery thanks to buoyant domestic and external demand and good progress in vaccination rollouts. This rebound supported employment recovery to pre-pandemic levels and also led to a sharp increase in exports. However, the economy continues to face significant risks from high macro-financial volatility associated with the Lira\\'s depreciation.3 2. In addition to Covid-19, climate change4 and natural disasters, such as earthquakes have been among the most critical threats to Türkiye’s development. In the last two decades, extreme climate-induced events have occurred with greater frequency and intensity; there were 984 extreme weather events in 2020, 935 in 2019, and 840 in 2018.5 Several parts of the country have experienced severe drought in recent years contributing to increasing water scarcity. Climate change impacts on water scarcity are expected to pose a major threat to agricultural productivity, rural incomes and employment, and food security.6 The long-term average annual losses due to disasters in Türkiye are estimated at about US$2,200.4 million per year for earthquakes7 and US$843.4 million for floods. Together, these hazards are expected to result in losses of around US$1.5 billion per year. In August 2021, severe flash flooding in Türkiye’s Black Sea region killed 17 people and required evacuation of more than 1,400 people from the affected areas. Similar floods in March 1 Baez, Javier E., and Asli Demirgüç-Kunt. 2021. \"The Urgency of Promoting a More Equal Recovery: Insights from the COVID-19 Crisis in Türkiye.\" February 9, 2021, https://blogs.worldbank.org/europeandcentralasia/urgency-promoting-more-equal-recovery-insights-covid- 19-crisis-Türkiye. 2 Data source: World Bank DataBank, https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS?locations=TR. 3 Rab,Habib Nasser; Knight,David Stephen; Yasar,Pinar; Atas,Erdem; Cuevas,Pablo Facundo; Nebiler,Metin; Ozen,Etkin.

Page 8 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) 2023 in the southeastern cities of Şanlıurfa and Adıyaman killed at least 21 people. Türkiye was also hit by two major earthquakes in Kahramanmaraş and Hatay in February 2023, causing major devastation in 11 provinces. Turkish authorities estimate that the economic cost of the disasters will be around 104 billion dollars (around 9.0% of the GDP forecast)8. The country’s vulnerability has been exacerbated by the two devastating earthquakes that struck the southern provinces of Türkiye on February 6, 2023, which have reportedly caused the collapse or extensive damage to tens of thousands of buildings, including housing, public buildings and historical structures, and to critical infrastructure in the region. The impact is still unfolding, with implications for growth, labor markets and poverty, as well as the overall macroeconomic framework. 3. Current projections suggest a temperature increase of 3–4°C on average across Türkiye from 2041 to 2070, as well as uneven changes in precipitation patterns. These in turn are expected to affect the temporal and spatial distribution and availability of water resources and increase the occurrence of floods associated with intense precipitation, coastal storms, and droughts. Rapid growth in the last two decades has caused its environmental footprint to increase rapidly. Total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rose from 219.6 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MtCO2e) in 1990, to 488.144 million metric tons in 2018 and 506.1 in 2019.9 4. While water can be a source of risk in extreme contexts, the sector is also a key enabler of development and Türkiye has an opportunity to move towards a more resilient, green, and inclusive growth path as its economy recovers from COVID-19. Water is strongly linked to domains that are critical for economic growth such as agriculture, energy, health, the natural environment, regional development, and poverty alleviation. It supports important economic, social, and job-related agendas, including rural development and agriculture revitalization, as well as industry and services such as tourism. It is also essential for ensuring public health and hygiene, an aspect that has become even more evident in the face of recent stressors such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Water and its related ecosystems—including lakes, wetlands, and coastal zones—also provide a wide range of environmental and disaster mitigation benefits, such as flood protection, pollution abatement, and biodiversity conservation. B. Sectoral and Institutional Context Sector Context 5. Türkiye is a water-stressed10 country, with climate change, urbanization, and economic activities posing significant risks to its water security. Over two-thirds of the country’s 25 river basins are facing water scarcity, yet demand is steadily increasing. In 2018, total water withdrawals reached 61,094 million cubic meters (m3), almost double compared to 28,073 million m3 in 1990. By 2023, water withdrawals are projected to increase to about 112 million m3.11 About 85 percent of annual freshwater withdrawals in 8 https://www.sbb.gov.tr/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Turkiye-Recovery-and-Reconstruction-Assessment.pdf 9 Data source: https://www.statista.com/statistics/956997/greenhouse-gas-emissions-Türkiye/ https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=37196&dil=2 10 Water stress is the ratio of total water withdrawals to available renewable supply in an area. In high-stress areas, 40 percent or more of the available supply is withdrawn every year. In extremely high-stress areas, that number goes up to 80 percent or higher. A higher percentage means more water users are competing for limited supplies. 11 Ministry of Urbanization and Environment 2016 (Climate Change Development Report Background Note 3) Page 9 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) Türkiye in 2017 were used for agriculture, 10 percent for domestic purposes, and 5 percent for industry. An estimated 95 percent of exploitable groundwater resources are now being used for irrigation, domestic, and industrial purposes. Irrigation consumes about two-thirds of the total. The negative impacts of climate- induced water scarcity have been most severe in basins where populations and economic activity are concentrated, including those hosting large cities and economic hubs (Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, and Antalya), as well as important agricultural areas such as the Konya plains. According to a 2016 climate change assessment,12 water demand may exceed Türkiye’s exploitable water level as early as the 2030s, in a worst- case scenario. Irrigated agriculture would be the hardest hit, which would in turn affect the country’s economy. According to Türkiye’s Climate Change Development Report (CCDR), a 10 percent reduction in water supply could cost Türkiye about $50 billion, about 6 percent of GDP. 6. Water quality is another major concern due to widespread water pollution from the discharge of untreated industrial and domestic wastewater and diffuse pollution from fertilizers and pesticides. One- third of Türkiye’s lakes and up to half of its rivers are currently considered either ‘contaminated’ or ‘highly contaminated’ by nutrients, particularly phosphorus and nitrogen which are linked to pollution from municipal wastewater and agricultural runoff. Climate change-related warming of the Marmara Sea combined with widespread pollution from the discharge of untreated industrial and domestic wastewater, fertilizers, and pesticides contributed to the mucilage crisis in 2021 that threatened aquatic life, tourism, and fisheries. Addressing these threats necessitated a holistic approach to water management at the city and/or basin level to improve management of municipal and industrial wastewater, complemented by efforts to address pollution from the application of agricultural fertilizers and pesticides. In 2003, Türkiye adopted the Integrated Water Resource Management Policy,13 and by the end of 2023, should complete river basin management plans (RBMPs) for its 25 river basins, in line with European Union Water Framework Directives. Water Supply and Sanitation 7. Türkiye achieved notable progress in providing water supply and sanitation (WSS) service to its population; in 2019, about 99 percent was connected to a piped water network.14 Nonetheless, the increasing demand and scarcity of water resources threaten reliable and sustainable service delivery. Many areas are experiencing both physical water scarcity and economic water scarcity.15 Sector performance indicators, such as high non-revenue water (NRW),16 are on average more than 40 percent17 across the country. High energy use reflects significant system inefficiencies. The average energy consumption of Municipal Water and Wastewater Administrations (SKIs)18 per 1,000 subscribers is 212,126 kWh/year. The average share of energy expenditures in SKI total budgets is 20 percent, ranging between 7 and 43 percent, and the share of renewable energy sources in the energy consumption is 4 percent on average. Thus, adaption to strengthen 12 Ministry of Forestry and Water Affairs, 2016; Climate Change Development Report Background Note 4 13 Türkiye: Integrated Water Resource Management at River Basin Level 2003, https://www.iowater.org/avancementdenosprojets/Türkiye-integrated-water-resource-management-river-basin-level-2003. 14 World Health Organization (WHO)/ United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Program data 15 Economic water scarcity in this case refers to inadequate management of water resources even where infrastructure may be in place. 16 Programs to address NRW are being implemented through various initiatives at the municipal level. 17 Comparative Performance Assessment of Metropolitan Water and Sewerage Administrations, June 2022 (https://www.suen.gov.tr/Suen/catdty.aspx?val=5525) 18 Responsibility for the provision of WSS, lies with the General Directorate of Water and Wastewater Administration (Su Ve Kanalizasyon Idaresi, abbreviated SKIs). Findings were based on data from 26 out of 30 Metropolitan SKIs. Page 10 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) resilience to climate induced scarcity and reduce GHG emissions make energy efficiency improvement a top priority for the sector. 8. Access to safe sanitation is relatively high, but inefficiencies in wastewater management continue to threaten water quality and environmental sustainability. In 2020, 91.1 percent of the urban population and 59.1 percent of the rural population received sewerage service.19The rest of the population used on- site sanitation systems, mainly septic tanks. Wastewater treatment capacity in Türkiye has steadily increased as a result of sustained investments in the last decade, with the number of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in operation in 201920 and the share of the population served by WWTPs growing from 36 percent to 79 percent between 2004 and 2018 (Turkstat 2019). In 2020, the wastewater from 74 percent of Türkiye’s total population, 77.7 percent of the municipal population, and 13.1 percent of the rural population, was treated. However, a large proportion only undergoes primary or secondary treatment, indicating a substantial amount of wastewater is discharged untreated into the environment.21Although industries are required to treat their wastewater before discharge, about 38 percent of industrial wastewater is discharged untreated into the environment. Seepage of untreated sewage from aging sewerage networks and collectors also contributes to water and environmental pollution in many parts of the country. 9. Reuse of treated wastewater is relatively low in Türkiye, although untreated wastewater is widely used informally by farmers for irrigation in many parts of the country. According to a recent International Water Association (IWA) paper,22 Türkiye has 26 WWTPs with different capacities of reuse facilities, but only 15 of them reused the treated wastewater in 2017. The other WWTPs do not operate their wastewater reuse/reclamation facilities due to design, mechanical, or operational problems associated with tertiary treatment. More attention needs to be paid to improving the quality of ageing infrastructure and operation and maintenance (O&M) services across the entire sanitation service chain, from collection and treatment of wastewater, to strengthening the capacity of SKIs to improve management of plants that have tertiary treatment facilities and reuse components in a sustainable manner, including management of the interface with the end users of reclaimed wastewater. Irrigation and Drainage 10. Türkiye has over 60,000 km2 of irrigated land, a sophisticated State Hydraulic Works Agency, and a long tradition of emphasizing extension of irrigation and drainage (I&D) service delivery. Türkiye also is one of the countries with the highest investment in I&D in the world, and the ninth largest agriculture producer. Agriculture in Türkiye is heavily dependent on irrigation, which triples productivity, compared to rain-fed agriculture, and provides for steady agricultural production and food security. Agriculture also plays an important role in the economy, employing about 15.8 percent of the total workforce in 2022.23 Climate change 19 Source: TURKSTAT Water and Wastewater Statistics, 2020 Bulletin dated 16 December 2021. https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Water-and-Wastewater-Statistics-2020-37197 20 International Water Association data, 2019 21 Source: TURKSTAT Water and Wastewater Statistics, 2020 Bulletin dated 16 December 2021. https://data.tuik.gov.tr/Bulten/Index?p=Water-and-Wastewater-Statistics-2020-37197 22 22 Source: Bilgehan Nas, Sinan Uyanik, Ahmet Aygün, Selim Doğan, Gürsel Erul, K.

Page 11 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) patterns, however, are expected to have significant impacts on yields, especially by increasing water scarcity and thus threatening agricultural productivity, rural employment and incomes, and food security. While agriculture is the second largest sector in the country’s economy, agricultural areas decreased from 26.3 million hectares in 2001 to 23.7 million hectares in 2016. Currently, the Global Food Security Index ranks Türkiye 47th for overall food security. The projected increase in population and decrease in agriculture area will make food security a major challenge in the future. 11. Despite substantial investment in recent years, Türkiye’s irrigation sector is characterized by low- performing and inefficient irrigation schemes and obsolete infrastructure. The open channel and flood systems in many parts of the country have contributed to substantial losses and unsustainable use of water resources. Freshwater productivity24 (US$17 per m3 in 201725) is low compared to that in high-income countries (US$47 per m3 in 2016). Moreover, many farmers are tapping into limited groundwater supplies, contributing to over-exploitation of the resource. They also are using untreated or partially treated wastewater to sustain their crops, thus posing significant risks to public health and safety. Moreover, the heavy reliance on groundwater has caused underground water levels to drop by more than two meters in river basins (for example, Konya) in the past five years, contributing to unsustainable water supplies. To improve irrigation efficiency, the GoT launched an extensive irrigation modernization program, supported in part by the World Bank through the ongoing Türkiye Irrigation Modernization Project (TIMP). Institutional Context 12. The mandate for developing and managing water resources and related services in Türkiye involves multiple institutions; thus the achievement of sector goals will require a coordinated effort. The Ministry of Environment, Urbanization, and Climate Change (MoEUCC) is responsible for environmental protection and rehabilitation, and for assessment and monitoring of the environmental impacts of projects and other activities. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (MoAF) is responsible for developing policies on protection of water resources and their sustainable use, and for coordinating all national water management issues. The MoAF conducts its water management role through two general directorates: (a) the General Directorate of State Hydraulic Works (DSI) and (b) the General Directorate for Water Management (GDWM). MoAF is also supported by a national think tank, the Turkish Water Institute (SUEN). Responsibilities for specific water management functions at the local level have been delegated to subnational governments. 13. DSI is responsible for development, planning, and management of surface water, groundwater, and land resources, while GDWM is responsible for developing policies to protect and sustain water resources. DSI’s primary focus is to plan, design, construct, and operate dams, hydroelectric power plants, water supply and wastewater treatment infrastructure,26 and irrigation schemes as well as to implement structural flood protection and control measures. DSI operates through 26 regional directorates, whose boundaries correspond largely to the country’s river basin boundaries. Since 2011, it has been active in the sanitation sector. In 2021, it had 21 active WWTP projects. DSI invested in 3,221 irrigation systems in 2020, resulting in an additional 7 million ha of irrigated land. In its 2022 investment program, DSI had a pipeline of 190 irrigation 24 Water productivity is defined as the amount of agricultural output per unit of water depleted 25 Data source: Türkiye – Water Productivity, Knoema, https://knoema.com/atlas/Türkiye/Water- productivity#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20water%20productivity%20for,per%20cubic%20meter%20in%202017. 26 There are some overlapping mandates in terms of development of WSS infrastructure with other institutions, such as SKIs, depending on the respective jurisdictions. Page 12 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) projects with an aggregated value of about US$27.5 billion. GDWM is responsible for developing policies for protecting and sustaining water resources, coordinating and preparing RBMPs, and developing national water quality standards and monitoring systems. At the local level, water user associations (WUAs) are responsible for managing irrigation services at the interface with farms. In 2018, WUAs were managing irrigation O&M on 89 percent of the total irrigated land in Türkiye. 14. Municipalities are responsible for provision of water supply, sanitation, and other municipal services.27 Türkiye currently has 30 metropolitan municipalities, each having a General Directorate of Water and Wastewater Administration (Su Ve Kanalizasyon Idaresi, or SKI) that manages WSS services. SKIs are public utilities with an autonomous budget. There are now more than 1,400 municipalities, including 30 metropolitan municipalities, 51 non-metropolitan municipalities, over 900 district municipalities, and 400 town municipalities. The amendment to the Metropolitan Municipality Law (Law No 5216) in 2012 gave metropolitan and district municipalities the authority and responsibility to provide services for supporting agriculture. SKIs are at the heart of institutional efforts to develop and implement innovative, resilient, inclusive, and efficient means to deliver reliable, safe, inclusive, transparent, and responsive WSS services to households while exploiting, where feasible, opportunities to provide alternative water sources, such as treated wastewater for irrigation, industry, and other uses. 15. Municipal investments are financed through government grants or loans from ILBANK (Iller Bankasi Anonim Sirketi), Türkiye’s national municipal development and investment bank. ILBANK is affiliated to MoEUCC, which provides loans to municipalities for developing municipal investments, including WSS investments, as a financial intermediary. In addition to its own resources, it borrows directly from multilateral financiers, including the World Bank, and receives grants from donors to support municipalities through on-lending or on-granting of the proceeds from these sources. ILBANK has an active portfolio in the WSS sector, where it has been operating since 2006 through the Water Supply, Sewerage, and Infrastructure Program (WSSIP) and several Bank-financed operations including the Municipal Services Project, Sustainable Cities Projects (P128605, P161915, P170612) and Municipal Services Improvement Project (P169996). In addition to the wastewater management investment, Ilbank also developed Integrated Urban Water Management Plans and NRW Management Guideline for municipalities. 16. Türkiye’s National Water Plan for 2019–2023 cites several policy, institutional, and regulatory (PIR) bottlenecks which undermine efficient and effective achievement of the country’s sector development goals. They include: (a) a highly fragmented institutional architecture with multiple entities at the national, local, and basin-wide levels, in some cases having over-lapping institutional mandates; (b) necessity to improve coordination among sector institutions; (c) lack of public awareness and participation in water resources management; and (d) complex legislative framework of regulatory enforcement of key functions. Delayed approval of the draft Water Law (originally submitted for GoT approval in 2016 and resubmitted in 2018) addressing some of these bottlenecks resulted in the current status quo whereby the sector remains governed by a complex legislative framework that affects regulatory enforcement, thus augmenting unpredictability and risks. 17. Several policy, institutional, and regulatory factors pose challenges to wastewater reuse. Currently, the only specific legislation in force in Türkiye addressing reuse of treated wastewater is the Communiqué on Technical Principles for Wastewater Treatment Plants (no: 27527, published in the Official Gazette dated 20.03.2010). 27 Metropolitan municipalities cover populations of 750,000 people. Page 13 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) However, the PIR analysis carried out by the Bank as part of project preparation revealed that it has limited information on important aspects such as roles, responsibilities, and management of risks, and focuses only on irrigation reuse with no clear standards for other potential uses. Responsibilities for wastewater reuse are also shared between two different ministries. The MoAF is in charge of preparing a new “Reuse National Master Plan” and 10 pilots under the project “Reuse of Treated Urban Wastewater for Different Alternatives” (2021-2024). The MoEUCC determines treatment standards for wastewater treatment plants (in accordance with policies developed by MoAF on receiving water bodies), issues discharge permits, monitors the performance of wastewater facilities, and regulates wastewater tariffs. Other challenges relate to the enabling environment for implementing policy priorities such as mainstreaming circular economy principles in the water sector; institutional capacity gaps, particularly at the sub-national level on aspects of water management (for example, issues related to development and O&M of wastewater treatment systems with reuse elements); and overall coordination among key stakeholders. 18. There are wide gender gaps in workforce participation in the water and wastewater sector, as well as in participation and leadership in community-level irrigation and water management institutions. Women are largely under-represented as staff in SKIs and WUAs. A rapid survey undertaken in one SKI28 during project preparation found that women comprised only 9 percent of staff overall, 11 percent of staff in engineering positions, and 19 percent of managers. As seen in the Seismic Resilience and Energy Efficiency in Public Buildings Project (P175894), women’s representation in the engineering field is low. Similarly, an assessment carried out for the ongoing TIMP found that women represent between 7 to 18 percent of WUA members and are even less likely to be in decision-making positions (less than 2 percent of WUA councilors were women). 19. GoT aims to strengthen resilience to the growing climate and non-climate related risks of water scarcity and pollution. In its 11th National Development Plan (NDP), the GoT prioritized promotion of circular economy principles through increased wastewater treatment and reuse. The Plan includes a target for the reuse of treated wastewater from 1.2 percent (2018) to 5 percent by 2023, primarily for agriculture, but for other end uses as well. Further, as one of the key actions outlined in the Türkiye Green Deal Action Plan, the GoT prepared the Wastewater Treatment Action Plan for the period of 2017-202329. Among other measures, the Plan endorses revision of the technical standards required for WWTPs and preparation of studies to raise awareness about wastewater reuse. In addition, the Declaration of Türkiye’s First Water Council issued in October 2021 promotes other actions, including preparation of: (a) strategies and policies to encourage sustainable, efficient, and integrated urban water management; (b) a water efficiency strategy and basin-wide water efficiency action plans; (c) new NRW targets for municipalities; and (d) studies on financing, including full cost recovery pricing of water and wastewater to begin in 2023. Some of these initiatives are already being undertaken at central and local authority levels. 20. The reuse of treated wastewater can offer a double value proposition for Turkish municipalities. In addition to the environmental and health benefits of wastewater treatment, resources recovered (such as energy generated from biogas) can provide an additional revenue stream for SKIs by partially or fully contributing to reducing O&M costs and making WWTPs more environmentally and financially sustainable. Recognizing this potential, several municipalities in Türkiye have prioritized circular economy principles in their strategic plans, 28This case (Denizli SKI (DESKI)) was used as a proxy, although conditions may vary among SKIs 29 Available online at https://webdosya.csb.gov.tr/db/cygm/icerikler/aaep-2017-23-20180410110044.pdf Page 14 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) focusing on wastewater reuse and resource recovery30 for energy generation from methane capture. Article 29 of Türkiye’s Environmental Law allows for ‘incentives’ to SKIs whose WWTPs plants comply with effluent water standards in the form of refunds of 50 percent of their electricity costs, excluding taxes from electricity service providers for cost incurred. Nonetheless, Türkiye’s efforts to encourage performance improvements in water supply and wastewater reuse would only offset demand by 1-2 billion m3,31requiring significant efforts to increase irrigation efficiency and agricultural productivity. 21. The 11th NDP prioritizes expansion and modernization of irrigation systems to increase productivity and reduce water losses and GHG emissions. Global experience has shown in many countries that investing in modernization and efficiency improvement solutions alone does not resolve water scarcity because farmers can shift to more intensive cropping where farms are reclaimed and expanded. Thus, the modernization of irrigation schemes to increase efficiency will need to be paired with strong regulations and monitoring capabilities, as well as reforms to ensure that water allocation and pricing better reflect the economic scarcity of water. Such interventions must be accompanied by policy measures such as resource limitations through licensing, close monitoring, and capping water use through smart water meters. 22. Türkiye has been actively exploring the potential for introducing public-private partnerships (PPPs) in the I&D sector to encourage private financing and improve service delivery. This requires active policy and pilots to attract private investment and direct engagement of Türkiye’s extensive private sector in service delivery, and the World Bank has been facilitating policy dialogue and knowledge exchanges on these issues. Despite Türkiye’s rich PPP experience in the energy, health, and transport sectors, private sector participation in Türkiye’s water sector has been limited. C. Relevance to Higher Level Objectives 23. On February 6, 2023, two very large earthquakes hit Türkiye causing massive damage, significant loss of life and huge economic loss. The World Bank is responding to the impacts of the earthquakes with a package that includes mobilizing support through projects that were already active before the earthquakes and delivering new projects to provide quick response. The new projects are scheduled to be presented to the World Bank Board of Directors in June 2023. In parallel, the World Bank is continuing to deliver its regular program of projects which were being prepared before the earthquakes hit. This project is one of those projects that is part of the regular program. 24. The proposed project is aligned with the World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for Türkiye for FY 18–FY21 (Report No. 11096-TR, August 2017), which was extended to cover the FY22–23 period through the Performance and Learning Review (PLR) (Report No. 14253-TR, March 2020). The CPF is based on the findings of the Systematic Country Diagnostic (finalized in 2016) which highlights water availability and sustainable use as key challenges for Türkiye’s future development. Among its three focus areas, (1) growth, (2) inclusion, and (3) sustainability, the project is particularly aligned with focus areas 2 and 3. In addition, the PLR highlights the challenge of increasing equitable access to jobs and services to boost human capital and attenuate poverty during economic volatility, which has more recently been heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic. Under focus area 2 (inclusion), WBG support aims to consolidate Türkiye’s success toward achieving these twin goals while supporting efforts to reach those left behind. In water-stressed areas, 30 Valuable wastewater by-products include fertilizer and biogas. 31 CCDR Background Note 4 Page 15 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) this segment of the population is largely located in rural areas, where accessing water for irrigation is a challenge. The project will cover rural and urban areas that are facing increasing water stress and scarcity, due to the impact of climate change, as well as the threat of longer-term economic and social impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. 25. Consistent with focus area 3 (sustainability), Component A of the proposed project will address both adaptation and mitigation aspects of climate change. The reuse of treated wastewater will augment the available scarce freshwater resources, while the generation and use of bio-and solar energy will reduce GHGs emissions and contribute to the mitigation agenda. Enhancing the capacity of wastewater collection and treatment will also mitigate public health risks, which tend to be high during and after the occurrence of extreme weather events. In the project areas, floods and droughts are expected to become more intense and frequent, further exacerbating the spread and transmission of water-related diseases and exposure to harmful pathogens. Components B and C involve interventions that enhance the efficiency of irrigation water use and energy efficiency, which involve reductions in water and energy consumption per unit area. 26. The design of the proposed project builds on the World Bank Türkiye CCDR Background Note on Agriculture, Fisheries, and Water.32 The Background Note emphasizes the need to sustain water services delivery and strengthen resilience to growing water-related risks, as well as contribute to achieving its long-term net-zero vision. The document proposes a multi-pronged approach that involves investing in adaptation and mitigation, and strengthening institutional capacity and regulations for water resources management. The proposed adaptation and mitigation measures include: (a) investing in increasing and optimizing multi-purpose water storage; (b) investing in enhanced water-energy use efficiency in water systems by reducing water losses in water supply systems (NRW), reducing water losses in irrigation, switching from pumped to gravity-based systems, pursuing more efficient treatment technologies, replacing older treatment equipment, promoting demand management, and switching to more energy efficient forms of irrigation solutions; (c) modernizing I&D systems through more efficient conveyance and operation and management systems complemented by water-saving agriculture interventions (for example, high efficiency drip, remote sensing approaches, and automation); and (d) diversifying freshwater resources through circular economy approaches in the delivery of water services. The latter includes reducing water losses, recovering and capturing valuable resources such as biogas from wastewater treatment, and reusing treated effluents and resource recovery. Strengthening institutional capacity and regulations for water resources management focuses on policy and regulatory instruments that encourage demand-side management, circularity, and efficiency; establishing institutional coordination mechanisms based on incentives with key stakeholders; and extending knowledge about global warming and water scarcity by raising public awareness about water resources management. 27. The proposed project will contribute to achieving national development goals outlined in Türkiye’s 11th NDP (2019–2023). The NDP aims to increase the treated wastewater reuse rate from 1.2 percent (in 2018) to 5 percent (in 2023) and over 2 million ha of land for irrigation. The GoT plans to allocate budget resources to irrigate 750,000 ha of this land, and the MoAF seeks to develop new domestic and external financing methods to finance irrigation of the remaining 1.25 million ha. Modern water saving irrigation technologies, such as sprinkling and drip irrigation, will be deployed to improve water and energy efficiency to reduce GHG emissions. The NDP also promotes use of renewable energy technologies such as solar-powered pumping systems. 32 CCDR Background Note 3 Page 16 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) Box 1. From Analytics to Implementation: The World Bank’s Program to Support Türkiye’s climate commitments Türkiye’s Climate commitments. Türkiye ratified the Paris Agreement in October 2021 and committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2053. The Climate Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed with six Development Partners in October 2021 is supporting the implementation of Tü rkiye’s climate ambitions on mitigation, adaptation, and just transition. The World Bank’s programmatic support towards green transition in Türkiye. ✓ Analytics and Policy Advice: In June 2022, the World Bank Group published the Türkiye Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) as its first ever CCDR. The Türkiye CCDR outlines a potential Resilient Net Zero Pathway (RNZP) in line with the country’s net zero goal, adaptation and resilience needs, and economic growth and development priorities. It was prepared in coordination with the multi-year Türkiye Green Growth Analytical and Advisory Program—a platform to engage with Government on green transition more broadly. Among others, the Green Growth Program is supporting the Government to develop its Long-Term Strategy (LTS) for decarbonization and is informing the 12th National Development Plan. ✓ Investments: The signing of the Climate MOU enabled the identification of multiple new IBRD projects totaling over $2 billion, aimed at supporting sectoral transformations in energy, transport, industry, urbanization, and agriculture, water and forest management, the focus of this project. The pipeline of new climate projects also aim at leveraging green finance and engaging the private sector, building institutional capacity, and ensuring that the green transition is socially inclusive. Project contribution to Türkiye’s Resilient Net Zero Pathway ✓ The proposed project is fully aligned with the Turkiye CCDR. It aims to advance the CCDR’s priority number 5 of making growth more resilient and sustainable—by applying circular economy principles to water management. Specifically, the project will promote the reuse of treated wastewater for irrigation. In doing so it will implement a range of water and energy efficiency measures including: (i) resource recovery like biogas capture with energy generation facilities and sludge treatment; (ii) modernization of irrigation and drainage systems, (iii) promoting demand management to reduce excessive consumption; and (iv) strengthening capacity of institutions in charge of water management. 28. The proposed project is aligned with the WBG Global Crisis Response Framework (GCRF). The project is aligned with the first, third and fourth pillars of the GCRF (Pillar 1: Responding to Food Insecurity; Pillar 3: Strengthening Resilience; and Pillar 4: Strengthening Policies, Institutions, and Investments for Rebuilding Better). The project will promote green, resilient, and inclusive development (GRID) by supporting green and resilient wastewater and irrigation infrastructure investments to encourage inclusive growth, build human capital, and reduce the water and energy footprint of irrigation and wastewater services. Consistent with pillars 1 and 3, the project will support food production and producers through irrigation modernization and its focus on climate resilience. Pillar 4 will be supported through the project’s focus on policy reform and institutional strengthening to build resilience to the impacts of climate change on water availability. It also addresses the WBG Climate Change Action Plan (2021-25) (Report No. 136368), notably Objective 1 (Boosting Adaptation Financing). Progress towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 633 is part of the GRID 33SDG 6 is to “ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation services for all”. The individual targets of SDG 6 cover the entire water cycle and its interconnections: 6.1: provision of drinking water; 6.2: sanitation and hygiene; services; 6.3: treatment and reuse of wastewater and ambient water quality; 6.4: water-use efficiency and scarcity; 6.5: Integrated water resources management; Page 17 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) approach in that it promotes availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. Project Development Objective PDO Statement 29. PDO Statement. The Project Development Objectives (PDO) are: (a) to improve wastewater services and reuse; (b) to increase irrigation services and efficiency; and (c) to strengthen institutional capacity and coordination for managing water circularity and point source pollution reduction in selected water-stressed areas in Türkiye. 30. The Project will support the GoT in addressing the challenges of climate change-induced water scarcity and in reducing the wastewater pollution load in selected water-stressed34 areas. The PDO will be achieved through a three-pronged approach to strengthen water security and promote climate change adaptation and mitigation. The approach comprises: (a) wastewater treatment, reuse, and resource recovery (Component A) to support priority infrastructure and services sub-projects across the sanitation value chain in selected areas, including wastewater collection, treatment, and reuse for non-agricultural purposes, as well as resource recovery (for example, use of stabilized biosolids from sludge for agriculture and/or energy generation from biogas); (b) irrigation modernization and efficiency improvement (Component B), including investments that will support modernization of irrigation schemes to promote more efficient water and energy use and improved demand management, as well as reuse for irrigation; and (c) institutional strengthening, capacity building, and innovation (Component C) to strengthen institutional capacity and coordination and to enhance the enabling environment to promote sustainable O&M and stakeholder engagement for wastewater and irrigation infrastructure investments under the project through DSI. PDO Level Indicators 31. Achievement of the project objectives will be assessed through the following indicators: • Volume of of treated wastewater that is generated (m3); • People provided with access to safely managed sanitation services under the project (of which female (number);35 • Water users provided with new/improved I&D services under the project (of which female) (number); 6.6: protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems; 6.a: international cooperation and capacity-building; 6.b: local participation in water and sanitation management. 34 Water stress is described in footnote 9. For purposes of this project, water stressed basins include basins where 40 percent or more of the available supply is withdrawn every year. 35 This indicator measures the people provided with access to wastewater services as a result of the wastewater treatment facilities provided under the project. This is aligned with the SDG definition of improved sanitation facility at the household level that is not shared with other households and where excreta is safely disposed of in situ or treated off site.

B. Project Components 32. Component A: Wastewater Collection, Treatment, and Reuse (Cost Estimate: EUR 74.6 million). This component, to be financed through the ILBANK loan, aims to strengthen resilience to increasing climate change-induced water scarcity and to reduce environmental pollution in selected water-stressed basins through wastewater treatment, reuse, and resource recovery for municipal irrigation and other beneficial purposes.39 This component mainly contributes to the fourth pillar of the GCRF (through subcomponent A3) by supporting green and sustainable growth policies and strengthening policies, institutions and investments for rebuilding better . ILBANK, as the Borrower under this component will provide sub-loans (“Municipal Sub- loans”) to eligible SKIs40 (“Municipal Sub-borrowers”) to undertake infrastructure investments (including goods, works, and consulting and non-consulting services) to upgrade wastewater collection and treatment, and reclaim wastewater for resource recovery and reuse (“Municipal Subprojects”) (Subcomponent A1). Under Subcomponent A2, the Project will also support completion of preparatory activities for infrastructure investments under subcomponent A1 of the project. 33. 34. Subcomponent A1: Construction and Upgrade of Wastewater Collectors and Treatment Plants with Reuse and Resource Recovery Potential (Cost Estimate: EUR 72.9 million). This subcomponent will provide sub- loans from ILBANK to eligible SKIs for goods, and works related to wastewater collection, treatment, reuse, and resource recovery infrastructure investments. The investments will include: (a) extension or rehabilitation of priority raw wastewater collection and conveyance systems; (b) expansion or upgrading of existing WWTPs with reuse potential; (c) rehabilitation and retrofitting of WWTPs in operation with biogas capture and energy generation facilities and/or sludge treatment processes, allowing for the recovery of these subproducts for reducing energy-related operational costs or for other end uses such as agricultural or industrial use; and (d) development of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems for monitoring wastewater quality, as required. Innovative technical solutions for all of the above have the potential to reduce capital and operational costs and contribute to improved water and energy security while reducing GHG emissions. For example, biogas production through sludge digestion can contribute to meeting wastewater ut ilities’ energy 36 This indicator refers to the increase in irrigation efficiency realized by the reduction of conveyance losses by use of modern irrigation methods based on closed rather than open channel methods. Values and targets refer to efficiency increase, in absolute percentage points from baseline, averaged over project schemes. 37 Protocols in this case will entail appropriate instruments such as Wastewater Reuse Agreements between wastewater treatment service providers, specifically DSI. 38 The baselines and targets provided in Section VII are indicative and will be finalized during the first year of implementation depending on the agreed scope of works and feasibility studies. For Component A indicators, targets have been provided based on Konya WWTP for which data is available as of now. 39 In line with the GoT’s 11th NDP, the subprojects to be prioritized under this project will focus on wastewater reuse and resource recovery for irrigation. However, opportunities for wastewater reuse and resource recovery for other purposes such as irrigation of municipal areas and industry will be explored where appropriate and due consideration will be given to improved financial sustainability. 40 Semi-autonomous SKIs manage water and wastewater services in metropolitan municipalities (over 750,000 people), while for non- metropolitan municipalities the services are managed by municipalities directly. Page 19 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) needs, and the use of biosolids for agriculture can reduce sludge transport and disposal costs. Several of the potential SKIs that expressed interest in participating in the project, including those in municipalities such as Konya, prioritized biogas production in their feasibility studies and designs. To ensure the long-term sustainability in the management of the wastewater investments, and their resilience to climatic and non- climatic events, and innovation, the SKIs receiving sub-loans will be required to commit (under the Sub-loan agreement) to prepare performance improvement action plans for the investments (the preparations for such performance action plans are expected to be supported by the World Bank through a trust fund). 35. Sub-project selection. Investments to be financed under this component will be located in a water-stressed area included in ILBANK’s pipeline of municipal wastewater collection and treatment. ILBANK, in close consultation with and based on demand from municipalities, will identify potentially eligible municipalities to receive investment financing under the project based on the following eligibility criteria: (a) aligned with existing national and/or municipal plans and policy documents (such as the national Annual Investment Program and municipal development plans; (b) maturity and readiness of the investment based on completeness of technical studies, such as pre-feasibility and designs; (c) demand for treated wastewater41 and potential for resource recovery and related benefits; (d) scale of the subprojects and estimated costs vis- à-vis the available resources; (e) will not trigger OP 7.50 - Projects on International Waterways; and (f) SKI creditworthiness. Subproject eligibility and prioritization criteria should additional investments be considered in the future will be elaborated in the Project Operations Manual (POM) to be prepared by ILBANK.42 Selected investments will be subject to a more detailed technical appraisal by ILBANK based on a review of existing pre-feasibility and design documentation. 36. Subcomponent A2: Technical Support for Preparation and Implementation of Investments in Wastewater Treatment (Cost Estimate: EUR 1.6 million). This subcomponent will finance sub-loans to municipalities for consultancy services to support preparatory activities under Subcomponent A1, including: (a) review of existing designs, development of detailed engineering designs of the treatment and monitoring systems (SCADA), resource recovery, and preparation of bidding documents;43 (b) construction supervision; and (c) preparation of required environmental and social management instruments, such as Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) and Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs); (d) carrying out citizen and community engagement activities and trainings to facilitate effective two-way engagement among stakeholders on pertinent issues relating to the Project and to broader water circularity, efficiency improvement and resilience through online surveys; and e) energy and operational efficiency audits in wastewater treatment plants for participating Project Municipalities/SKIs. Energy is often the costliest component of WSS operations, and energy efficiency and renewable energy serve both to reduce emissions of GHGs and advance climate goals while strengthening financial performance. Making these utilities more efficient or even transforming them into energy producers (of renewable sources for example, by capturing and using generated biogas) are effective ways to manage and reduce operational costs, hedge against fluctuations in energy prices, ensure long-term operational sustainability, and increase the resilience of water systems.44 For most urban WSS utilities, investments in energy efficiency generate the highest returns. Audits 41 Demand is defined as demonstrated willingness to use treated wastewater for specific purpose. 42 ILBANK and DSI are to prepare two separate POMs each of which will elaborate on the respective roles of the entities with regard to project activities under this component. 43 In certain subprojects, procurement may be conducted based on design and build or design-build and operate contracts which may not require the full scope of preparatory work described under this activity. 44 Mainstreaming Energy Efficiency Investments in Urban Water and Wastewater Utilities report by the World Bank: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/31927 Page 20 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) of existing WWTPs can also reveal excess capacity in some treatment processes, thus helping prioritize investments and lowering costs when plants need to be upgraded or expanded.45 37. Subcomponent A3: Institutional Strengthening, Capacity Building, Innovation and Gender (Cost estimate: EUR 0.1 million46). This subcomponent will support technical assistance activities to strengthen the participating SKIs in order to deliver resilient, efficient, innovative, and sustainable wastewater services across the sanitation service value chain. This activity will support institutional capacity-building activities including knowledge exchange workshops, study tours, training, and other activities aimed at promoting innovation and learning and sharing of best practices for sector institutions at central and local authority level within Türkiye, including ILBANK and SKIs on aspects relating to promoting water security and resilience as well as training for municipal staff encouraging the female staff in technical and leadership skills, gender diversity training, gender sensitization of all employees and management, and mentorship programs. To help narrow the gender gap in employment of women in technical roles in the engineering sector in Türkiye, the ILBANK PMU and the SKI PIUs will encourage design and supervision firms to include more female experts in their staff by receiving additional technical points during proposal review. Given the volume of design and supervision services required in this Project, there is a real opportunity to advance the professional experience of female experts and technical professionals through this Project47. The project will also implement the Equal Aqua survey48 in the participating SKI/s with Bank support to capture data on female and male employment and diagnose any barriers to promote equal opportunities for women. 38. Component B: Rehabilitation, Construction, and Modernization of Irrigation Systems (Cost Estimate: EUR 318.75 million49). This component will be financed through a Government of Türkiye loan, to be implemented by DSI, to finance goods, works and consultancy services relating to rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure to improve water and energy efficiency and productivity. This component contributes to two of the pillars of the GCRF, specifically: (i) Pillar 1, Responding to Food Insecurity, through support to the agricultural producers through irrigation systems; and (ii) Pillar 3, Strengthening Resilience, especially to water scarcity. Specifically, it would finance: (a) transformation of open channel irrigation systems to more water-efficient ‘closed’ (pressurized) irrigation systems to reduce non-beneficial water losses and conserve energy, (b) installation of irrigation hydrants and smart water meters for the piped irrigation systems, and (c) development of new or existing irrigation schemes to be supplied by treated wastewater in selected basins. Support to WUAs for adopting modern, more efficient on-farm irrigation systems such as drips and sprinklers is the responsibility of TRGM under a separate Government program. 39. Activities under this component will lead to significant mitigation benefits by reducing non- beneficial water losses, improving water and energy efficiency, and helping to increase carbon sinks by assisting in enhancing storage of soil carbon through an increase in irrigated land. Moreover, the adaptation co-benefits will be 45 See the case of “Optimizing WWTP in Sao Paulo”. World Bank, 2020: https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/36245/Water-in-Circular-Economy-and-Resilience-WICER-The-Case-of- Sao-Paulo-Brazil.pdf?sequence=5 46 Opportunities for identifying complementary grant resources from Bank Executed Trust Funds and technical assistance for supporting some of the knowledge sharing and capacity building activities will be exploited by the Bank where available. 47 Bidding consultancy firms that include females in at least 20 percent of key positions will receive additional points during evaluation of bids. 48 https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/water/brief/inclusive-water-institutions-platform 49The cost estimate does not include cost for irrigation schemes to be fed by treated wastewater under the initial identified potential scheme (Konya) and will be financed through future financing. Page 21 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) achieved by: ensuring climate resilient infrastructure, ensuring efficient and fair allocation of water resources, reducing excessive and unproductive use of water leading to more volume available during droughts, and reducing unsustainable abstraction of groundwater to enhance resilience to droughts and rising temperatures, and to prevent the occurrences of sinkholes. 40. Subcomponent B1: Conversion of Open Mains, Secondary, and Tertiary Canals to Pressurized Pipelines and Rehabilitation of Associated Infrastructure (Cost Estimate: EUR 265 million). Activities under this subcomponent will include (a) the conversion of open concrete-lined trapezoidal main, secondary, and tertiary canals to closed, buried, and pressurized pipelines and (b) rehabilitation of head structures and pumping stations, including the electrical and mechanical components; and (c) consultancy services for LMPs, ESF studies and Dam safety experts, and goods for dam safety measurement. The project is expected to finance the modernization of at least three irrigation schemes or subprojects located in priority water-stressed provinces, as identified by DSI and included in its Strategic Program as well as the GoT’s Annual Investment Plan (AIP). The subprojects will be selected from a long list of schemes identified by DSI and submitted to the SBO under a framework approach, based on specific criteria agreed with the parties and the World Bank. The final schemes will be confirmed by DSI in collaboration with GoT’s SBO by project effectiveness. However, an indicative list of three potential schemes to be included have been proposed by DSI (table 1). The total or gross area to be irrigated by these tentatively identified schemes is estimated to be 30,396 ha, benefiting more than 19,651 people. The source of water for the schemes are existing reservoirs created by building dams on rivers or creeks and groundwater (existing). Table 1. Indicative50 List of Potential Irrigation Schemes Irrigation Scheme Gross Service Area (hectare) Pazarcık Kartalkaya Dam Irrigation Scheme 20,431 Karakuyu (Dombay) Pumping Irrigation Scheme 1,100 Sarimsakli Dam Irrigation Scheme 8,865 Total 30,396 41. Subcomponent B2: Installation of Irrigation Hydrants and Smart Water Meters to the Piped Irrigation Systems (Cost Estimate: EUR 53 million). This subcomponent will support the installation of prepaid meters to water intake facilities in existing piped irrigation systems as part of Türkiye’s Effective Use of Water in Agriculture Program. DSI plans to purchase and install a total of 80,000 prepaid water meters with hydrants in about 556,000 ha irrigation area in 25 of its regions under the Program, of which this project will finance the installation of 50,000 prepaid water meters with hydrants with an estimated cost of EUR 53 million. The remaining 30,000 meters will be installed using the Government’s own finances. Associated investments will include additional structures, pipes, and other appurtenances which will be encountered in the transportation and installation of the meters on site. The meters will allow for volume-based monitoring and payment with metered water intake for about 250,000 ha of irrigation area which are unmetered. The meters will allow for volume-based monitoring and payment with metered water intake for about 387,964 ha of irrigated areas which are unmetered. The use of water meters is expected to prevent farmers’ excessive water consumption habits and to increase irrigation efficiency due to less water consumption. On average, the irrigation water use per hectare is 10,262 m3 in Türkiye for open canal and low-pressure systems, 8,430 m3 per ha in piped irrigation systems, and 6,452 m3 per ha in systems where the volume-based tariff is applied. Introducing hi- 50 The list of schemes is to be confirmed by loan effectiveness. Page 22 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) tech irrigation in the absence of controls on water allocations may lead to increases in consumption per unit area. The installation of water meters allows for proper monitoring of water use at the farm level. The project design includes water audits (under Component C) which will inform water allocation and pricing policy decisions. 42. Subcomponent B3: Feasibility studies and designs for Wastewater Tertiary Disinfection Units and Associated Irrigation Water Distribution Networks for Reclaimed Wastewater Conveyance (Cost Estimate: EUR 0.2551 million). This subcomponent will finance: (i) feasibility studies and designs for tertiary disinfection units for wastewater treatment plants that will treat wastewater for irrigation purposes (Subcomponent B3.1), and (ii) feasibility studies and designs for irrigation water conveyance infrastructure for the treated wastewater for irrigation purposes (Subcomponent B3.2). The feasibility studies and designs for the disinfection units and those for the associated irrigation network will be approved by DSI and SBO prior to implementation of relevant investments. Once approved, the investments will be included in the AIP and DSI may request for additional loan financing from the World Bank. DSI will coordinate implementation of this subcomponent closely with respective SKIs as needed, including data and information sharing for the future investments. (a) B3.1 Feasibility studies and design for wastewater disinfection units. These activities will be implemented by DSI. DSI will be responsible for the procurement of relevant consultancy services for these activities. The disinfection units comprise discrete infrastructure components of the WWTPs that will treat the wastewater to meet the quality standards required for reuse for irrigation. Goods and works related to the construction and installation of relevant investments may be financed through future financing that may be requested by DSI from the Bank should the feasibility studies for such investments be approved by SBO52. In such case, the respective SKI will be responsible for operation and maintenance (O&M) of the entire wastewater treatment plant systems, including the disinfection units, to ensure a smooth transition between the main treatment plants, disinfection units, and the irrigation schemes that will use the treated wastewater, but DSI will own the disinfection units. A protocol arrangement will be established between DSI and the relevant SKI to allow for clarification of aspects such as O&M of the disinfection units. (b) B3.2 Feasibility studies and design of irrigation networks using treated wastewater. This subcomponent will finance the feasibility studies and designs for the irrigation network that will convey the treated wastewater for irrigation to farms. These activities will be implemented by DSI, which will be responsible for the procurement of relevant consultancy services for these activities. The irrigation networks will be owned by DSI. Priority will be given to schemes located in basins characterized by severe water scarcity and groundwater depletion, such as Konya and potentially others to be identified. Goods and works related to the construction and installation of relevant investments will be financed separately through additional financing to be requested by DSI from the Bank once the feasibility studies and investments are approved by SBO. (c) Preparation of a Wastewater Reuse Protocol templates. Preparation of a Wastewater Reuse Protocol 51 This cost currently covers only the feasibility studies. DSI intends to seek additional financing for this sub-component to cover the construction costs once the feasibility studies are completed and approved through a separate financing agreement. 52 It is noted that any request for additional financing would be subject to the approval of SBO.

Subcomponent B4: Provision of Technical Support to Participating WUAs (Cost Estimate: EUR 0.5 million). This subcomponent aims to strengthen the capacity of WUAs participating directly in the project, particularly those involved in the use of treated wastewater for irrigation, on key aspects linked to managing irrigation schemes. Activities supported under this subcomponent will include: (a) consultations with WUAs in coordination with DSI on safe use of treated wastewater and incorporation of their feedback in the final design of the schemes. This subcomponent will also; and (b) support for women’s participation and voice in the context of WUAs by. The latter will aim at increasing the employment of women as WUA staff; awareness raising about the importance and benefits of women’s membership and leadership in WUAs; and providing capacity building activities for female WUA members, staff, and women farmers in the use of smart agricultural and irrigation technologies, products, and markets, etc., to enhance opportunities for women in the field positions. The adoption of on-farm water-efficient irrigation technologies and agronomic practices is an essential element of the irrigation modernization agenda of Türkiye. However, the Government has a dedicated national program for facilitating the adoption of water efficient on-farm technologies. These interventions will address the risks associated with increasing the projected increase in water demand and reduced water availability projected due to climate change by increasing efficiency of water use and enhancing the safe and economic utilization/use of the treated wastewater. 44. Component C: Institutional Strengthening, Capacity Building, and Innovation for irrigation services and implementation of circular principles in water (Cost Estimate: EUR 1.0 million from RoT loan). Component C will support technical assistance activities to strengthen the institutional capacity and coordination of sector institutions at national and local authority levels in order to deliver resilient, efficient, and sustainable irrigation services and to support strengthening of key elements of the enabling policy, institutional, and regulatory (PIR) environment for promoting implementation of water in a circular economy principles in Türkiye. An analysis of the PIR elements supporting water in a circular economy and resource recovery (WICER) activities carried out by the World Bank as part of project preparation identified priority areas for institutional strengthening and capacity building, in consultation with key stakeholders from the GoT, including ILBANK, DSI, SUEN, and other sector agencies. Details on the PIR findings and broader priority interventions are provided in the project files. Proposed technical assistance activities under this component contribute to the GCRF Pillar 4 - Strengthening Policies, Institutions and Investments for Rebuilding Better. It will specifically support the following: 45. Subcomponent C1: Study and Roadmap for Strengthening Reused Wastewater Financing and Regulatory Mechanisms (Cost Estimate: EUR 0.1 million). Implemented by DSI, in collaboration with other key stakeholders, this activity will support consultancy services to develop appropriate financing mechanisms to cover CAPEX and OPEX costs for wastewater reuse and resource recovery for different uses. The subcomponent will include a study to explore tariff and subsidy levels; tariff setting methodologies; cost recovery levels and affordability; willingness to pay for water, wastewater, and irrigation services; and financial modelling options. The study will identify medium- to long-term pathways to promote progress in cost recovery that will be both affordable to consumers and financially sustainable for the SKIs and municipalities. 53This activity will not be financed through the loan. It will be carried out by DSI internally with advice and global lessons as needed shared from the Bank through its Water in a Circular Economy Business line. Page 24 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) 46. Subcomponent C2: Stakeholder and Citizen Engagement Activities for Activities Implemented Through DSI (Cost Estimate: EUR 0.25 million). This activity will support consultancy and non-consultancy services implemented by DSI to develop and promote broad understanding and buy-in to project interventions, ensure citizen engagement in project design and implementation, and facilitate GRMs throughout the project cycle. Specific activities will include: (a) development and implementation of community scorecards, (b) engagement of WUAs as the main institution responsible for local water management structures supported by the project and for participatory monitoring of reclaimed wastewater quality, and (c) development of a beneficiary feedback system for a timely response to community level grievances and issues. This activity will also support DSI and WUAs in implementing awareness campaigns directed at the end users of treated wastewater to inform them about project activities as well as to communicate risks and mitigation measures. 47. Subcomponent C3: Energy Audits for Irrigation Systems (Cost Estimate: EUR 0.25 million54). This activity, to be implemented by DSI, will support detailed Energy and Water Audits of the irrigation systems that will be selected for rehabilitation and modernization in Subcomponent B1. The assessment will include estimation of the potential reduction in energy use, peak demands, water losses, and GHG emissions through improved pumping efficiency, re-design, and rehabilitation of electrical and mechanical structures. This technical assistance subcomponent will also include an assessment of international experience with the benefits and costs of prepaid water meters (for example, reduction in water use and losses, increase in irrigation efficiency, increase in area irrigated, and related co-benefits that may include reduction in energy use and GHG emissions). This assessment will also be beneficial in designing the structure of the implementation program for the prepaid meters. The findings of these activities will inform policy and regulatory interventions such as water allocation and pricing decisions. 48. Subcomponent C4: Capacity Building, Training, and Innovation (Cost Estimate: EUR 0.15 million). This activity, to be implemented by DSI, will support knowledge exchange workshops, study tours, training, and other activities aimed at promoting innovation and learning and sharing of best practices for sector institutions at the central and local authority level on aspects relating to water security and resilience. These activities will promote various global partnerships between Türkiye and countries with similar water policies, such as Portugal, Australia and the United States, with whom the Bank is working closely on water management knowledge aspects. Specific topics will focus on, but not be limited to: (a) management of water in a circular economy and use of non-conventional water resources, including wastewater reuse for irrigation and other purposes and resource recovery; (b) priority topics on broader water resources management, such as water storage, water allocation and accounting, and monitoring. Türkiye is also developing and implementing innovations on various water management aspects, such as its new Water Management Information System (SUTEM),55 and it will be able to contribute to global knowledge through this component. More substantive investment and non-investment interventions on broader water resources management 54 The Bank is exploring grant resources to co-finance these activities. 55 SUTEM is a GIS enabled Management Information System designed to support smart-decision making and increase the WUAs operational efficiency by centralizing data related to physical (irrigation network condition, type of water source and availability, etc.), socio-economic (total number of water users/farmers, crop types and cropping patterns, etc.) and managerial (assessment and collection of service charges, investment needs, etc) aspects of the targeted irrigation schemes. Ultimately, the MIS will support sustainable land management for agricultural uses by encouraging more efficient water use, better crop management, and multi-stakeholder planning and investment. Turkiye Irrigation Modernization Project finances: (i) upgrading of national WUAs database, to allow performance monitoring on various dimensions (O&M, water conservation, financial management, governance, M&E, and communications); (ii) provision of equipment to WUAs, to enable their participation in the platform; and (iii) training of WUAs to improve technical and financial management capacity. Page 25 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) aspects will be considered in another parallel operation in the pipeline56 involving DSI, focused on flood and drought management and integrated water resources management. 49. Subcomponent C5: Support for Piloting an Irrigation Scheme under PPP Arrangement (Cost Estimate: EUR 0.25 million). This subcomponent will support the assessment of innovative financing and business models for financing and managing specific irrigation subprojects. An appropriate PPP model will be identified and readied for piloting in at least one irrigation scheme. DSI intends to develop 1000 ha pilot PPP irrigation scheme based on a BOT by engaging the private sector. The purpose of this subcomponent is to assess the technical feasibility and financial viability of this pilot scheme. Currently the proposed pilot PPP irrigation scheme is at the pre-feasibility or pre-viability stage requiring additional detailed assessment. This component will perform:(a) pre-feasibility/pre-viability analysis of a limited array of PPP options other than BOT, including brief highlights of potential irrigation PPP models; (b) initial assessment of the feasibility of the proposed irrigation PPP models in the context of Türkiye under the current policy; and (c) an evaluation of the proposed pilot PPP irrigation scheme, including an initial estimate of the risk-based priority investment plan. A study tour will be organized to expose Türkiye officials to international PPP practices and enhance their knowledge about various PPP models in irrigated agriculture, specifically those used in Spain and Morocco. The final output is a financially viable PPP model for implementation. 50. Component D: Project Management (Cost Estimate: EUR 1.4 million, comprising EUR 0.4 million for ILBANK and EUR 1.0 million for DSI). This component will have two subcomponents that finance project management costs for ILBANK (Subcomponent D1) and DSI (Subcomponent D2). Eligible activities will include consultant and non-consulting services, goods, training, and operating costs required by ILBANK (Subcomponent D1) and DSI (Subcomponent D2) to implement the project according to World Bank policies and guidelines. These will include consultant services to support implementation of procurement and financial management (FM) aspects, social and environmental risk management and climate change-related aspects, technical and contract management, M&E, and project reporting and communications, as agreed with the World Bank. It will also finance incremental operating costs, including goods and consulting services required to support DSI, ILBANK, and the municipalities’/SKIs’ day-to-day project coordination and supervision activities in the above areas as well as workshops and other events required to facilitate project management. C. Project Beneficiaries 51. The project will yield benefits on two levels: populations received improved services and institutions. The primary beneficiaries of the project will be (a) the population that benefits from the access to improved wastewater collection and treatment services and reduced environmental pollution, and (b) communities and farmers who would benefit from improved access to irrigation services, specifically in terms of efficiency and reliability, with accompanying potential for enhanced productivity, income, and livelihoods in a post-COVID- 19 context. The total envisaged number of beneficiaries for the Wastewater treatment services are 1,000,000 people, and for the irrigation services are estimated at 4,880 people. The total estimated number of project beneficiaries based on envisaged activities will be updated once the full scope including the beneficiaries of the irrigation schemes that will use the treated wastewater are determined after the relevant feasibility studies are completed. The second group of project beneficiaries are the staff of sector institutions, including 56 The proposed Flood and Drought Management Project is envisaged for Fiscal Year 24? Page 26 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) the MoAF, DSI, and beneficiary municipalities, utilities, and WUAs which would benefit from the project- financed technical assistance for institutional strengthening and capacity building activities. Project Cost and Financing 52. The total project costs are estimated at EUR 395.75 million. The lending instrument will be an Investment Project Financing (IPF), which will provide an IBRD loan of EUR 320.75 million to the Republic of Türkiye and EUR 75 million to ILBANK with the Guarantee of the Republic of Türkiye (through the MoTF). The project will be implemented over a seven-year period given the nature of the proposed infrastructure investments and the design approach requiring coordinated feasibility studies involving multiple stakeholders. This timeframe will allow sufficient time for completion of ongoing feasibility studies as well as stakeholder engagement and tendering prior to construction and operationalization of the wastewater treatment and reuse investments. Completion of large irrigation schemes also requires several years for construction. Table 2.

Results Chain 53. The project will support the GoT in addressing the challenges of increasing climate change induced water scarcity and reducing the wastewater pollution load in select water-stressed basins. The project will contribute to addressing these challenges by supporting the following innovative technical solutions and interrelated interventions: (a) upgrading wastewater collection, treatment, and provision of reclaimed wastewater for reuse; (b) rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure to improve water and energy efficiency and productivity; and (c) strengthening institutional capacity and coordination at the national level, as well as at the local level for management of water resources in a circular economy and reducing point source pollution. In the long run, these outcomes will: contribute to improved public health, enhance sustainable use and integrated management of water resources, strengthen climate resilience, and reduce GHG emissions in selected basins of the country. Figure 1 illustrates the project’s Theory of Change. Page 27 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) Figure 1: Theory of Change E. Rationale for Bank Involvement and Role of Partners 54. The World Bank is a leading partner globally and in Türkiye in the water security agenda, including WSS service provision, water for agriculture, and water resources management as well as strengthening resilience to climate and non-climate risks in the sector. The Bank has had a long-term engagement in Türkiye’s water sector and is currently financing several infrastructure investment operations, including TIMP, the Sustainable Cities Series of Projects, and the Municipal Services Improvement Project (MSIP) for refugees in Türkiye. The Bank has also been engaged in policy dialogue and provision of technical assistance on various water-related topics, including PPP in irrigation. World Bank support for the proposed project will be instrumental in addressing water security and resilience while promoting low-carbon interventions in selected water-stressed basins. The proposed project is expected to present an opportunity to further this collaboration in strengthening sector resilience to climate change and other shocks. 55. The World Bank’s convening power and its ability to support countries in the implementation of ‘proof-of- concept’ approaches is critical in developing new programs that can be scaled up and potentially leverag e additional financing from development partners for future rollout. Given the water security challenges in Türkiye, the overall investment needs are much larger than existing government resources. The World Bank has had initial discussions with other development partners, including the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, about this project and potential co-financing opportunities for scaling up project activities in the future. Page 28 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) F. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design 56. The project design draws on global lessons implementing wastewater and irrigation projects. These include the implementation of several wastewater treatment, reuse, and resource recovery operations in Mexico, Tunisia, USA, and Australia, as well as irrigation modernization activities implemented by DSI in Türkiye. The following are the main lessons reflected in the project design. 57. Adequate stakeholder engagement and institutional coordination are critical for successful implementation of wastewater reuse and resource recovery operations. Lessons from similar operations globally57 show that reuse and resource recovery projects can be delayed or fail if stakeholders have not been adequately engaged in the process of assessing and addressing negative perceptions of reclaimed water and reuse products. Thus, the project includes stakeholder engagement activities to promote buy-in from stakeholders and ensure demand for treated wastewater prior to construction. 58. More efficient water management by improving the performance of existing irrigation systems often has higher returns on investment than infrastructure expansion. While Türkiye still has ambitious targets for expanding the area under irrigation, there is a growing realization that improving the performance of existing systems has higher returns on investment, and therefore should receive high priority. Thus, the World Bank’s engagement in irrigation and the design of this specific project are accordingly focused on modernization of existing irrigation schemes. 59. The introduction of efficient irrigation systems on total water use does not always lead to water savings without adequate controls. In the absence of controls on water allocation, farmers often increase overall water consumption by expanding land under irrigation in response to the more productive technology. Therefore, the irrigation schemes to be financed under the project have been included in the respective basin management plans, which limit the amount of water that can be used for irrigation, while safeguarding the allocations for drinking water, environment, and other needs. The project is also supporting the introduction of smart water metering for irrigation schemes as part of the activities designed to encourage water conservation and savings. 60. Based on lessons from Spain, Morocco, and other countries, risks linked to the financial viability of PPP in irrigation schemes can be substantial if the partnership is not professionally designed. The lessons emphasize the need for appropriate revenue streams, and optimal risk transfer allocated among the public and private sector. Not having these elements in place hinders the bankability of PPP schemes in irrigation. Thus, the proposed project focuses on developing a bankable business case rather than being transaction driven. III. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS A. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements 57Delgado et.al. 2021.” Water in Circular Economy and Resilience”. World Bank, Washington, DC and Rodriguez et al. 2020. “From Waste to Resource: Shifting Paradigms for Smarter Wastewater Interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean.” World Bank, Washin gton, DC. Page 29 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) 61. The project will have two Loan Agreements with different borrowers and implementing agencies. A Loan Agreement for Components A and D1 will be signed between the World Bank and ILBANK as the Borrower and implementing agency under financial intermediary arrangements. Legal arrangements for these activities will also include a Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Türkiye and the World Bank, as well as sub- financing agreements between ILBANK and beneficiary sub-borrowers (metropolitan municipalities as well as their affiliated SKIs) for subprojects under Component A. ILBANK will on-lend the loan proceeds to the SKIs or municipalities responsible for managing water and wastewater infrastructure in participating municipalities through the sub-financing agreements. 62. A second Loan Agreement will be signed between the Republic of Türkiye and the World Bank with DSI as the implementing agency for activities under Components B, C and D2. The Law on Public Finance and Debt Management No. 4749 (the Debt Law) describes the procedures for international borrowing in the Republic of Türkiye. The Debt Law classifies the international borrowing under three categories: allocation, on-lending, and guarantee. The debt law authorizes the MoTF to allocate foreign-financed loans to DSI, which is a special budget institution. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements under ILBANK 63. ILBANK will be the implementing financial intermediary for Components A and D1. Implementation arrangements will be based on the existing, well-established model used under the ongoing World Bank- financed operations in the municipal sector such as the Sustainable Cities Series of Projects (SCP1,2 and AF) (P128605 and P161915) and the Municipal Services Project in Refugee Affected Areas (MSIP) (P169996) co- financed through an IBRD loan and the European Union’s Facility for Refugees in Türkiye (FRIT). The project will be implemented through an existing Project Management Unit (PMU) established under ILBANK’s International Relations Department, as is the case under the SCP 1 and 2 and MSIP. ILBANK has extensive experience managing the implementation of municipal infrastructure investments as a financial intermediary and has demonstrated its capacity for managing World Bank loans through these projects. The project will include capacity building measures to further strengthen ILBANK’s capacity through training and additional staff deployment as required in view of its growing portfolio. ILBANK will maintain at all times the PMU for purposes of the project, with terms of reference and qualified staffing satisfactory to the Bank. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements under DSI 64. DSI will be responsible for implementing Components B, C, and D2, in close coordination with relevant stakeholders. MoTF will allocate the loan proceeds to DSI to implement activities as described. DSI has a long history with the World Bank and is familiar with Bank’s systems and procedures. It also is the implementing agency for the ongoing TIMP and was involved in previous World Bank-financed lending operations completed in the 1990s. In addition, DSI is one of the implementing agencies of the TULIP under the World Bank’s Environmental and Social Framework (ESF). In DSI, the project will be implemented by the Project Management Team (PMT) established in the Department of Projects and Investments (Proje ve Insaat Daire Baskanligi, DPI) which is currently implementing the TIMP. However, it will be important to strengthen DSI’s capacity for applying the World Bank’s ESF because this will be only the second operation implemented by the agency to use this framework. DSI will be at all times the PMT for purposes of the project, with terms of reference and qualified staffing satisfactory to the Bank. WUAs will be responsible for O&M of irrigation systems after they are completed and transferred by DSI. Page 30 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) 65. Municipalities and SKIs. At the subnational level, Component A of the project will be implemented by SKIs under their respective municipalities, with support from ILBANK. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be established for the project in the participating SKIs to be responsible for implementation of the WWTP subcomponents with technical support from ILBANK. The SKIs will be responsible for O&M of these systems after completion. 66. Wastewater Reuse Agreements. Templates for wastewater reuse protocols (reuse agreements) between SKIs providing treated wastewater for reuse and potential end users such as DSI58 for irrigation reuse. These protocols will clarify what would be the respective rights and institutional roles and responsibilities of these stakeholders and will seek to optimize the design and operation of wastewater treatment and reuse. The protocols will specify aspects such as future: (a) compliance with wastewater quality standards; (b) minimum wastewater quantities; (c) implementation and coordination roles and responsibilities by SKIs, DSI or other end user, such as WUAs;59 (d) on-site supervision; (e); monitoring requirements and other aspects as will be defined in the protocols. 67. Other agencies. In light of the policy interventions required to address the water security challenges, as well as the related overlapping responsibilities for some of the water infrastructure development, O&M, and service delivery functions, other agencies or departments responsible for key aspects of water management may need to be consulted or involved in project activities such as knowledge sharing or capacity building events during implementation to achieve a satisfactory outcome. These may include the General Directorate of Water Management under the MoAF, MoEUCC, and MoTF. 68. Project Operational Manual (POM). ILBANK and DSI will develop detailed POMs for project implementation for each of the respective loans, setting out (a) policies and procedures relating to implementation of project components; (b) FM and procurement arrangements and procedures; (c) environmental and social risk management obligations and procedures; and (d) project coordination arrangements. Both ILBANK and DSI will have prepared and adopted POMs satisfactory to the Bank by loan effectiveness. B. Results Monitoring and Evaluation Arrangements 69. ILBANK’s PMU will ultimately be responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and reporting project performance, working in close collaboration with relevant SKI’s PIU for Component A. Similarly, DSI’s Project Management Team (PMT) will be responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and reporting project performance, working in close collaboration with DSI’s regional departments for Components B and C. In addition to professional staff from relevant DSI departments and regional offices, the PMT will include a full- time M&E officer. The activities implemented through DSI will be monitored through its existing management information system (MIS), which will be further enhanced by the implementation of the national, web-based, and geographic information system-enabled participatory water monitoring system for the WUAs being developed under TIMP. The PMT will be responsible for providing project performance reports to the World Bank semiannually. 58Under the framework approach, other end users could be eligible, for example for industrial or other purposes, 59Under the scope of this Project, Wastewater Reuse Agreements/Protocol templates will be drafted by DSI to inform development and operation of future wastewater reuse activities. While ILBANK will not be party to such Agreements/Protocols, DSI may directly study/receive comments and inputs from the water and wastewater administrations (SKIs) located in the agricultural areas. Page 31 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) 70. A mid-term review (MTR) of the project will be carried out around three years after commencement of the project. The MTR will assess overall implementation progress and identify and resolve any key issues affecting implementation. An evaluation will also be carried out at the end of the project to provide input to the Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) which evaluates final results, assesses overall performance, and captures key lessons. C. Sustainability 71. Institutional sustainability. The project includes technical assistance activities aimed at addressing some of the binding policy, institutional, and regulatory constraints, and improving capacity and coordination across institutions for implementing circularity and efficiency improvements in water and wastewater services to improve water security in Türkiye. Targeted capacity building and SKI commitment to preparing and implementing performance improvement plans60 to enhance asset management and overall O&M of the services will enhance sustainability.61 72. Water resources and environmental sustainability. The reuse of treated wastewater supported by DSI’s clear water allocation process will augment freshwater supply in water scarce areas, attenuating the need for over- abstraction of groundwater by farmers and enabling further ecological flows. The project will contribute to reductions in GHG emissions and environmental pollution through improved management of wastewater to ensure compliance with required standards, and recovery of resources such as biogas. Conversion of open concrete-lined main, secondary, and tertiary canals to closed, buried, and pressurized pipeline irrigated land will result in reduced water losses. In addition, the metering of irrigation systems on an area of 387,964 ha will result in water saving by enabling adoption of efficient on-farm irrigation systems and practices (financed by other government programs as well as private investments). However, actual water saving will only be possible if the promotion of higher efficiency irrigation with the same amount of water withdrawals is complemented by regulation and control of total water consumption. Consumption-based water management is critical for regulating water consumption to ensure environmental sustainability in water scarce basins, as will be included in this project. The project will also introduce robust environmental and social management instruments for the selected schemes to protect the environmental and social integrity of the water resources. 73. Financial and economic sustainability of wastewater investments and services will depend on the ability of the SKIs to mobilize the necessary technical and financial resources to manage the new assets effectively. ILBANK conducts creditworthiness assessment of all participating SKIs as part of its selection criteria for sub- borrowers. The proposed project design also encourages subprojects which aim to either lower O&M costs (for example, by increased energy efficiency, generating energy from biogas, and reducing sludge management costs) or create additional revenue streams for the utility from treated wastewater or biosolids from sludge. For the irrigation schemes, the economic analysis of Component B indicates financial viability at the household level, and financial viability at the scheme level because of the expected agriculture benefits. 60 SKIs may be supported through complementary technical assistance activities, such as the Utility of the Future 60 (UoF) Bank-executed trust fund, which provides support for utility performance improvement 61 The Bank provided earlier support to Konya’s utility (KOSK I) for preparing a diagnostic of its overall performance against several good practice utility matrix, and preparation of a 100 day and 3 to 5-year action plan for addressing critical priority actions identified by the utility. Through the project, additional UOF support will be provided to support the utility on aspects relating to enhancing implementation of its circular economy priorities and other priorities to be identified in a participatory manner. Page 32 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) Turkish law requires WUAs to repay the scheme modernization costs over a 25-year period, and the WUAs in successful irrigation schemes have a strong record of repayments. The high up-front costs of these schemes are typical of irrigation projects; however, their benefits are expected to positively transform the local economies over the long term. IV. PROJECT APPRAISAL SUMMARY A. Technical, Economic and Financial Analysis Technical Analysis 74. The investments under Component A will be selected from eligible subprojects from interested municipalities/SKIs included in the Government’s Annual Investment Program (AIP). The World Bank reviewed and conducted technical due diligence on potential sub-projects to be financed based on project information documents, and pre/-feasibility studies from SKIs, such as Konya Water and Wastewater Utility (KOSKI), which expressed demand for a sub-loan for the upgrade of its existing WWTP with the inclusion of circular economy principles, including watering of green areas, as well as the recovery of biogas from sludge. Detailed technical appraisal of the final selected sub-projects will be performed once approved by the Strategy and Budget Office of the Presidency (SBO). 75. The feasibility studies and existing design documents for the subprojects will be elaborated further considering the needs based on the key drivers of the project, including water scarcity, investment needs identified by municipalities/SKIs, and demand for treated wastewater, including for irrigation purposes as assessed by DSI, or required by irrigation unions or farmers. Other uses, such as the irrigation of municipal parks or industrial processes could also be considered, where feasible, including if combined with other uses such as irrigation for agriculture. The end-use will be identified and chosen before the design of the tertiary treatment to ensure a fit-for-purpose approach. Other factors to be considered will include an analysis of alternatives, soundness of the engineering designs, economic and financial analysis (EFA) of the projects, and soundness of the estimated budget compared to international and national benchmarks. The technical designs will explore innovative solutions that will promote cleaner technologies and resource recovery, energy efficiency improvement, and lower emissions. Procurement procedures for these WWTPs with the potential for reuse and resource recovery would consider appropriate approaches such as the Design and Build or Design, Build, Operate, and Transfer, allowing for technical innovation. Innovative technical solutions will seek to reduce operational costs and contribute to water and energy security while reducing GHG emissions. Knowledge sharing on innovative solutions to implement them will be promoted with relevant Turkish stakeholders through Component C. 76. Readiness. For Component A, technical assistance and consultancy activities to be financed during the first 18 months of implementation have been identified. Preliminary technical designs for the WWTPs have been prepared for sub-projects in several potential beneficiary municipalities, such as Konya. However, the feasibility studies for the tertiary/disinfection units for treating wastewater for reuse for irrigation are under preparation by DSI. For Component B, the technical aspects of the indicative list of irrigation schemes have been reviewed and conform to good practice. The schemes are located in various parts of the country with high agricultural production potential due to favorable local climates, soils, farming skills, and market links, all of which are demonstrated by a long period of continuing operation of the existing schemes. Farmer Page 33 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) willingness to adopt efficient on-farm irrigation systems is also readily evidenced in many areas by farmers using private assets to install pumps for operating drip irrigation systems. 77. The engineering designs for modernizing the irrigation systems in each scheme have been optimized for local conditions, especially the expected cropping patterns. The designs are fairly robust to adaptive changes in technology and farming models. In almost all places, they are designed for commercial agriculture instead of low-value crops. Further, the design parameters are conservative and robust to reduce O&M costs while allowing for gradual water efficiency improvements. Finally, the designs are being finalized based on consultations with WUAs, which have resulted in improvements that will make the investments more sustainable and reduce O&M costs. 78. Due to the higher efficiency of modernized irrigation systems, there will eventually be an approximately 40 percent reduction in water use per hectare, compared to the current levels. Reduction in water use will eventually result in a reduction in energy consumption. It will also reduce the level of groundwater use for irrigation. For example, in the Afyonkarahisar Dinar Irrigation Scheme, the use of groundwater will end in an area of 555 ha, corresponding to approximately 3 hm3 of groundwater. Expected changes in cropping patterns will also help increase farmers’ incomes. With the implementation of on-farm irrigation measures (not financed by the project but supported by Türkiye’s national program and expected to happen gradually during and after the project), the total water demand for the schemes will be lowered from an estimated 286 MCM (original allocation) to 194 MCM, eventually creating a net water saving of 92 MCM. Proposed irrigation modernization schemes under Component B are ready to commence implementation in the first eighteen months. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS (EFA) 79. An indicative EFA was performed in two parts: first, separately for the major project components and subcomponents, to provide economic justifications for their inclusion in the project, and second, for the whole project, to assess its overall financial and economic viability. The cost-benefit analysis for the WWTP investments is exemplified by Konya WWTP because other WWTPs are in the early design stages with resulting data constraints and lack of preparedness. The detailed results are presented in a technical annex (not attached to this PAD). FINANCIAL ANALYSIS 80. Financial implications for water and sewerage administration for Konya. The financial net present value (FNPV) was found to be US$27.4 million with a Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) of 15.6 percent. In addition, the creditworthiness and cashflow analysis carried out for Konya utility indicate that the utility maintains the capacity to service its debts using its own operating surplus as indicated by a healthy debt service coverage ratio. Extrapolations of the results for Konya to Component A indicate that overall, the planned investment in WWTPs is financially viable with a combined FNPV of US$83 million. 81. Impacts on farm-household incomes. Farm income analysis with and without the project indicates that the project has significant impacts on the income of participating farmers. The change in income ranges from 14 percent to 42 percent (see table 3). Page 34 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) Table 3.

Financial implications at scheme level. The results of the scheme-by-scheme financial analysis are summarized in table 4. The results demonstrate that the modernization of irrigation schemes is financially viable, with Financial Internal Rate of Return (FIRR) ranging between 19 percent and 46 percent, and a Financial Net Present Value (FNPV) ranging between US$46 million and US$139.2 million. The sensitivity analyses show that these results remain robust to potential capital and O&M cost escalations and substantial reductions in benefits. Table 4.

WWTPs. Investments in WWTPs generate large positive externalities such as public health benefits and protection of surface and groundwater resources, which may be difficult to accurately value and monetize. Nonetheless, the economic analysis for the rehabilitation and upgrade of WWTPs is conducted assuming three scenarios for the without-project scenarios: (a) no septic tanks, (b) presence of low-cost septic tanks, and (c) presence of high-cost septic tanks. The results of the economic analysis show that the investments at the Konya and other WWTPs are economically viable (table 5). The sensitivity analysis shows that the results remain positive under plausible capital and O&M cost increases, but the project is most sensitive to changes in benefits. Table 5.

B. Fiduciary 86. Financial Management. The proposed project FM arrangements are satisfactory to the World Bank. Both implementing entities have experience in implementing World Bank-financed projects. The current FM arrangements used by ILBANK for the implementation of SCP 1, 2, and AF 2 and MSIP and by DSI for the TIMP will be used for the proposed project. The PMU established under the International Relations Department of ILBANK will be responsible for the FM arrangements for parts implemented by ILBANK. Under Component A ILBANK will on-lend proceeds of the IBRD loan to the participating municipalities/SKIs and will provide technical support to these entities in implementing and overseeing implementation of the investments. Procurements will be conducted by the participating municipalities/SKIs. The concluded contracts will be signed by the relevant municipalities/SKIs. Payments to the suppliers/contractors/consultants will be registered directly by ILBANK upon submission of acceptable approval documents. The PMU in ILBANK will be responsible for the management of the Designated Account that will be opened for the part implemented by ILBANK and Project accounting and reporting of related parts (Component A and Subcomponent D1). The project financial statements that will be prepared separately for the part implemented by ILBANK will be subject to independent audit on an annual basis by the Treasury Controllers of the MoTF. The project audit report will be made publicly available on ILBANK’s website in line with the World Bank’s Access to Information Policy.

In DSI, the PMT established at the Department of Irrigation (Sulama Dairesi Baskanligi, DI) will be responsible for the project’s FM arrangements. DSI’s internal control systems will be utilized for this project. The DI (former Project Construction Department) with the support of the Strategy Development Unit will ensure that the annual investment budgets include allocations satisfactory for the timely implementation of project activities. The project procurement will be conducted centrally by the relevant departments of DSI. Relevant regional directorates will be responsible for construction oversight. There will be another Designated Account for the parts of the project implemented by DSI. Payments from the Designated Account that will be opened at the Central Bank will be registered by the PMT. The FM staff currently working on TIMP are qualified and have gained the required experience. The team might be supported with an additional FM expert if deemed necessary during implementation. Project accounting in the currency of the loan will be maintained by the PMT. The project financial statements will be audited by the Treasury Controllers of the MoTF. The project audit report will be made publicly available according to the Access to Information Policy of the World Bank. 88. Procurement. DSI and ILBANK62 as well as the potential beneficiary municipalities/SKIs are all public entities and will be responsible for procurement implementation under their respective subcomponents of the project. Thus, the World Bank Procurement Regulations for IPF Borrowers, dated November 2020 (Procurement Regulations), will apply to the proposed project. The World Bank’s Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants, dated October 15, 2006, and revised in January 2011 and as of July 1, 2016 (Anti-Corruption Guidelines), will also apply to the proposed project. A General Procurement Notice will be published on the World Bank’s external website and United Nations Development Business online. 89. The World Bank has conducted a detailed procurement assessment for the project, with a specific focus on the operating environment of DSI and ILBANK (due to the framework approach adopted under the Project, the participating municipalities/SKIs will be assessed as they become certain during implementation) in terms of: (a) procurement regulatory framework and management capability, (b) integrity and oversight, (c) procurement process and market readiness, and (d) procurement complexity. The assessment concluded that: (a) applicable procurement policies and the regulatory system are designed broadly to meet procurement principles of value for money, economy, efficiency, effectiveness, integrity, transparency and fairness, and accountability; (b) all project implementing entities have a clear system of accountability with clearly defined responsibilities and delegation of authority on who has control of procurement decisions; (c) there is a clearly identified target market for all procurements; and (d) DSI/ILBANK effectively manage contracts to ensure delivery according to the contract conditions. The assessment has been recorded in the Procurement Risk Assessment and Management System of the World Bank. 90. PPSD(s) for both project implementing entities have been prepared based on paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of the Procurement Regulations applicable for the project and agreed by the Bank. On the other hand, PPSDs for each sub-project under Subcomponent A1 and activities to be implemented by participating Municipalities under Subcomponents A1 and A2 will be prepared by its own sub-borrower under the coordination and support of ILBANK. The Procurement Plan of the project according to paragraph 4.4 of the Procurement Regulations has also been prepared and finalized for mainly DSI-related subcomponents. The PPSD prepared by ILBANK proposed that all procurements relating to WWTPs and design and supervision services will be conducted by the beneficiary municipalities/SKIs with support to be provided by ILBANK PMU. In addition, DSI’s relevant departments will handle the procurement activities for DSI subcomponents according to the 62 As the financial intermediary. Page 37 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) DSI PPSD. The procurement activities for all project-financed schemes will be conducted at DSI Headquarters centrally, and the regional directorates will be involved with regular supervision of construction and O&M aspects of the activities. 91. In the DSI PPSD, DSI proposed to use higher thresholds for the procurement of civil works contracts in the national market under Subcomponent B1 of the Project - up to US$115 million. Such high thresholds have been successfully used under the World Bank-financed TIMP (P158418). 92. The World Bank’s Systematic Tracking of Exchanges in Procurement (STEP) system will be used to prepare, clear, and update the project’s Procurement Plan in line with the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreements. Each implementing agency (ILBANK on behalf of the beneficiary municipalities/SKIs) and DSI (all relevant departments) will be given independent STEP access in the project portal and will create the Procurement Plan through STEP before initiating any procurement activity. 93. The World Bank’s review thresholds and procurement methods to be applied will be set out in the Procurement Plans of the project. The procurements not previously reviewed by the World Bank will be subject to ex-post review on a random basis in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph 4 of the Procurement Regulations. More details on the findings of the procurement assessment, the proposed procurement supervision arrangements, risks, and relevant mitigation measures to address them are provided in annex 1. .C. Legal Operational Policies . Triggered? Projects on International Waterways OP 7.50 No Projects in Disputed Areas OP 7.60 No . D. Environmental and Social 94. The environmental risk rating of the project is Substantial. The project’s environmental risk is mainly attributed to the type and scale of the project activities (wastewater collection, treatment, and construction of new irrigation schemes, and modernization/rehabilitation of existing schemes) and their wide geographic coverage of different basins. 95. The long-term environmental impacts of the project activities are expected to be positive because they will result in an improved wastewater treatment system and irrigation services. However, potential adverse environmental risks and impacts are also expected and are mainly associated with the civil works for the construction of wastewater collection and WWTPs, and the construction and modernization of irrigation schemes, installation of smart water meters to the piped irrigation systems, and their O&M. The potential environmental risks associated with the above activities include: (a) generation of noise, dust, vehicle exhaust, wastewater, excess material, and other wastes in the construction phase; (b) sludge and solid waste generation from WWTPs; (c) emissions of hydrogen sulfide, methane, ozone, and gaseous or volatile Page 38 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) chemicals associated with WWTPs; (d) occupational health and safety impacts such as accidents and injuries; exposure to chemicals including pesticides; noise and vibration; exposure to pathogens and vectors; physical, chemical, biological hazards, and water-borne diseases due to the potential presence of pathogens; (e) discharge and/or reuse of treated wastewater; (f) ecological impacts on nearby receptors, biodiversity, rural livelihood resources, and biologically and ecologically important sites; (g) impacts on cultural heritage sites; (h) deterioration of groundwater quality and changes in soil quality due to re-use of treated wastewater for irrigation; and (i) impacts on resource use (water, energy, and raw materials). Although the above risks and impacts could be significant, they are predictable, site-specific, and manageable. They can be prevented, minimized, or mitigated by proper assessment and application of adequate mitigation measures in line with national regulations, the Environmental, Health, and Safety General and Specific Guidelines (EHSGs), and the Good International Industry Practice. Any investment with high environmental risks will be excluded from financing under the project. 96. The social risk rating of the project is classified as Substantial. The project will finance the construction of two WWTPs and rehabilitation and modernization of existing irrigation schemes. These investments will have positive impacts over the medium and long term in ensuring more efficient and sustainable use of water resources. During the construction and operation stages, however, the investments carry substantial social risks. Specifically, the construction of WWTPs can pose the following social risks and impacts: (a) social tension and resistance regarding the siting of WWTPs and of potential use of treated wastewater due to lack of adequate stakeholder engagement; (b) adverse impacts to disadvantaged/vulnerable communities depending on siting choices; (d) labor and working conditions risks during construction; (e) community health and safety risks during construction and operation; (f) sexual exploitation and abuse/sexual harassment (SEA/SH) risks during construction depending on the size and sourcing of the workforce; (g) involuntary acquisition of agricultural land, loss of livelihoods, and possibly physical resettlement; and (h) risks relating to inadequate stakeholder engagement and grievance management. Rehabilitation and modernization of existing irrigation schemes can pose the following social risks and impacts: (a) labor and working conditions risks during construction, (b) community health and safety risks during construction and operation, (c) SEA/SH risks during construction based on workers travelling to remote/rural areas, (d) minor permanent and temporary land acquisition or easement restrictions affecting agricultural livelihoods, (e) risks regarding ability to pay based on installation of new water meters, (f) risks regarding willingness of farmers to use reclaimed wastewater, and (g) risks relating to inadequate stakeholder engagement and grievance management. 97. The environmental and social impacts are expected to be mostly temporary and predictable, and can be managed with adequate management plans, as well as human and financial resources. Management plans prepared for the project during preparation, by both DSI and ILBANK, include Environmental and Social Management Frameworks (ESMFs), Stakeholder Engagement Plans (SEPs), Ex-post Social Audit Reports, Labor Management Procedures (LMPs), and Resettlement Framework (RFs). During implementation, site-specific Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs), Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs), SEPs, Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) and contractors’ LMPs will be prepared for sub-projects. ILBANK currently does not have an integrated environmental and social management system (ESMS) sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Environmental and Social Standard (ESS) 9 on Financial Intermediaries. Thus, ILBANK is in the process of developing an ESMS with support from the World Bank to manage the environmental and social risks of its lending activities. The ESMS will be adopted no later than 60 days after loan effectiveness with no disbursements to take place until the ESMS is established. In addition, outputs of the technical assistance activities under the project may lead to downstream impacts regarding resettlement Page 39 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) and other social issues. These will be addressed through the integration of the relevant ESSs and mitigation measures in the relevant Terms of References for the activities. 98. Specific locations and final designs of the investments are not known at this stage but will be finalized during project implementation. The final selection of subprojects to be financed is subject to a decision to be made by national authorizing entities, including the SBO based on recommendations from DSI and ILBANK. The project will not finance any sub-projects categorized as having high environmental and social risk, such as those that may require significant involuntary land acquisition and physical displacement or that may have significant impacts on sensitive environments, such as natural and critical habitats as per ESS6. Further, any sub-project on International Waterways (OP/BP 7.50) will not be eligible for financing. The ESMF provides a screening mechanism to ensure such activities are screened out. 99. Consultation of the draft environmental and social documents has not yet taken place. ILBANK disclosed the draft E&S documents for the project starting February 03, 2023 on its website. DSI disclosed the draft documents starting January 31, 2023 on its website. The consultations should take place at the local level and include those benefitting and impacted by the investments or their representatives. The feedback from the consultations will need to be reflected in the assessment and summarized in the documents, and the documents finalized and redisclosed. 100. Safety of Dams. The project will finance rehabilitation, construction, and modernization of irrigation systems. Some of the irrigation systems draw water from existing upstream reservoirs and will depend on the storage and operation of the upstream dams for supply of water, and could not function if the dam failed. To ensure the safety of upstream dams, the borrower (GoT/DSI) will hire one independent dam safety expert with expertise in the technical fields relevant to the safety aspects of the dams, to: (a) inspect and evaluate the safety status of the existing dams, their appurtenances, and performance history; (b) review and evaluate the owners’ O&M procedures; and (c) provide a written report of the findings and recommendations for any remedial work or safety related measures necessary to upgrade the existing dam or DUC to an acceptable standard of safety. The Bank task team will work with the borrower and independent dam safety experts in applying the Good Practice Note on Dam Safety and the series of Technical Notes on Dam Safety to ensure that the recommended actions are being properly addressed and that project preparation and implementation are in compliance with the requirement of ESF/ESS4/Annex1 on Safety of Dams. DSI shall conduct dam safety assessments for all associated dams under Component B of the project and submit them to the Bank within 18 months of loan effectiveness. GENDER 101. There is a wide gender gap in access to economic opportunities. Women in Türkiye are much less likely than men to participate in the labor force (30.8 percent for women versus 68.2 percent for men in 2020)63 or to engage in entrepreneurial activities.64 Women’s lower participation in the workforce is particularly visible in technical (women comprise 36.2 percent of professional and technical workers) and managerial positions (the share of females at upper and middle-level management position is at 17.3 percent).65 These patterns 63 World Development Indicators (WDI), based on national data. 64 UN Women 2020. The Economic and Social Impact of COVID-19 on Women and Men: Rapid Gender Assessment of COVID-19 Implications in Turkey. 65 Turkish Statistical Institute. Page 40 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) are also visible in the water sector, where women are largely underrepresented in design/supervision firms, SKIs and WUAs. 102. Based on the 2017 Gender Assessment, Türkiye lags behind the upper-middle income countries in the Europe and Central Asia region in terms of gender aspects.66 Employment in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields is particularly relevant for advancing women’s employment and their income earning opportunities. The Türkiye Gender Assessment shows that in 2016, women employed in the electricity, gas, and air conditioning sectors earned more than their male counterparts because women tend to work mostly in white-collar positions.67 However, 2020 data show that women make up only 34 percent of the STEM workforce.68 At this rate, they will be left behind as digitalization and automation transform the world of work. The Covid-19 pandemic will only intensify the demands for higher STEM skills. According to research by the Turkish Industry and Business Association in 2014 on gender distribution among STEM graduates working in companies in STEM fields, the rate of male graduates was higher (64 percent) compared to women (36 percent), a finding that in part relates to a lower expressed preference of women to enter STEM related fields69. 103. In 2010, women in water and sewerage earned 10.2 percent less than men. The gender wage gap is due to, among other factors, segregation of occupations by gender, where women are in the less well-paid positions.70 During project preparation, a rapid survey was undertaken in one SKI71, which found that women comprised only 9 percent of staff overall, 11 percent of staff in engineering positions, and 19 percent of managers. Women accounted for 8 percent of new recruits in the past 12 months, and 25 percent of promotions in the last year were granted to female staff. The survey further found that some of the reasons behind women’s lower employment in the SKI, particularly in technical and managerial positions, could be explained by lower access to technical and leadership training,72 lack of flexible work arrangements, and lack of specific workplace facilities and amenities valued by female employees.73 Further, while women are more likely than men to complete tertiary education, they are less likely to be in the STEM fields. 74 104. Overall, there is a lack of data on female and male employment in water management or membership of WUAs in Türkiye. Gender-disaggregated data are not routinely collected by DSI. However, the Social Impact and Gender Assessment (SIGA) conducted for the TIMP (P158418) found that women represent between 7 percent to 18 percent of WUA members (that is, in the set of schemes where SIGA was conducted). While female farmers are extensively involved in agricultural production, they participate very little in decisions concerning irrigation.75 WUA membership does not translate into participation in decision-making and less 66 World Bank, 2018. Turkey – Country Gender Assessment 2017 (https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/35974) 67 2018 Women in Tech Index: https://www.honeypot.io/women-in-tech-2018/ 68 ILOSTAT data: https://ilostat.ilo.org/how-many-women-work-in-stem/ 69 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1256296.pdf 70 EPSU. 2013. The Gender Pay Gap in Public Services. (https://www.epsu.org/sites/default/files/article/files/Gender_pay_gap_FINAL_report.pdf). 71 The survey was conducted in Denizli SKI (DESKI) 72 Women comprise only 6 percent of leadership training participants and 20 percent of communications training participants 73 For example, the SKI has separate sanitation facilities for women and men (with the exception of at pumping stations), but these do not have safe locks. There are also no childcare facilities or lactation rooms on-site. 74 ILO STEM data, 2020. (https://ilostat.ilo.org/how-many-women-work-in-stem/). Women are underrepresented in STEM occupations (that is, the percentage of female STEM tertiary graduates is 34.7 percent and the percentage of STEM occupations for women is 33.7 percent). 75 FAO, National Gender Profile of Agricultural and Rural Livelihoods - Türkiye, 2016. (https://www.fao.org/3/i6192e/i6192e.pdf). Page 41 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) than two percent of WUA councilors were women (for example, in Atabey).76 Women’s lower membership and leadership in WUAs is explained by factors such as sociocultural norms that often assign leadership roles to men, lack of access to information and consultation platforms, and limited access to WUA training for women. 105. The project will address the above gender gaps through several actions under project subcomponents. Subcomponent A3 (iv) will promote equal opportunities for women through such actions as: (a) the ILBANK PMU and the municipal PIUs encouraging design and supervision firms to include more female experts in their staff by receiving additional technical points during reviews; (b) implementing the Equal Aqua surveys in the SKI/s in the project to capture data on female and male employment in the utilities and diagnose the barriers; (c) providing targeted training for female staff in technical, communications, negotiations, public speaking, management, and decision-making and leadership skills (provided at times and locations that facilitate female staff participation and targeted outreach to female staff to encourage their application to training programs); (d) providing gender diversity training and gender sensitization for all employees and management; and (e) establishing mentorship programs that match senior female employees with junior female employees with the aim of achieving better coordination and relations among the female staff in the utilities. 106. Subcomponent B4 (b) will promote gender equality activities in the WUAs and related institutions (for example, DSI), including: (a) Preparing and implementing an action plan in DSI regional branches and WUAs to explore and accommodate women’s professional needs and demands and help increase women’s participation in the decision-making positions in WUAs (WUAs in Türkiye are required by law to have at least one agricultural engineer as a member of staff. Reportedly, there are women engineers, managers, and technicians in state-run institutions that oversee irrigation, and these women may have opportunities to find technical and managerial positions in the WUAs); (b) Raising awareness about women’s knowledge and experience in irrigation and water management as well as the importance and benefits of women’s membership and leadership in WUAs; (c) Setting up separate women’s only WUA training to create a safe space for women to voice their concerns and priorities, and propose actions as a group; and (d) Providing targeted skills training to female WUA members, staff, and women farmers that informally use the irrigation system (for example, smart agricultural and irrigation technologies, products and markets, leadership skills, and communication) to enhance opportunities for women in field positions. The outcomes of these actions will be measured through two indicators: (a) increase in share of women in design and supervision consultancies contracted under the project who are technical staff and (b) increase in share of new staff positions created in WUAs held by women. Both indicators will be measured by percent of total new staff positions. CITIZEN ENGAGEMENT 107. Wastewater reuse projects are too often planned and implemented on the basis of mainly technical and financial feasibility studies. Planners tend to discard the relevance of the beliefs and values of a culture that determine the perceived need for reclaimed wastewater and the degree of acceptability of reuse by the 76 Türkiye Irrigation Modernization PAD. Page 42 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) people the project intends benefit, mainly farmers and consumers of crops irrigated with reclaimed water. In this regard, the International Water Association (IWA) Publishing’s Water Reuse Study in Türkiye 2020 and previous experience provided evidence that acceptability is conditioned by factors such as the type of crop, farmer water demand and freshwater availability, water tariffs, and farm revenue as well as other factors such as the socioeconomic status of the farmer, level of education, information available on the reuse project, cultural background, and the opinions of reference or peer groups. Considering these factors, the project will support the design and implementation of a public awareness campaign to provide information and raise awareness about the benefits of water reuse for irrigation and reduce negative public perceptions about food and crops irrigated by wastewater. The campaign will be in Turkish; use a mix of traditional and digital communication products; advertise the community scorecard; and disseminate information on project investments. 108. Adopting strong citizen engagement mechanisms to address the main determinants of reclaimed water acceptability in project design is essential to ensure the success of the reuse initiatives. Thus, the design of the project’s information and consultation activities will be based on a clear understanding of farmers’ preconceived opinions and attitudes toward reclaimed water reuse for irrigation. For this purpose, the project will include several citizen engagement activities targeted to irrigation perimeters and WUAs (for DSI irrigation schemes): (a) A survey among benefiting famers will gather information about their current agricultural activities (farm size, crops, production, irrigation practices and volumes, and cost of production factors), perceptions and opinions on reclaimed water irrigation (unsatisfied water demand, perceived risks and benefits of reuse, willingness to use and pay for reclaimed water), and demographic and socioeconomic data. Focus group discussions targeting local water users and WUA members (including those representing vulnerable groups) will gather qualitative information to help interpret the survey. The information gathered through this survey will also be instrumental to fine-tune the technical and institutional solutions to be presented and discussed with the farmers. (b) Community scorecards will facilitate regular participatory planning and implementation of wastewater reuse for irrigation investments and help assess users’ satisfaction with the performance of the reused wastewater schemes, collect feedback from irrigation users, and improve communication between DSI and WUAs. The scorecard initiatives will be conducted at regular intervals to track performance and identify additional ways to improve the performance of the schemes. (c) Frequent community roundtables will share information on project activities and disseminate and discuss the results of the scorecards and monitoring so beneficiaries know how the feedback was used to shape the design of the project, as well as any recommended changes. (d) A beneficiary feedback system will allow a timely response to community-level grievances and issues. In designing the system, the GRMs of the SKIs and DSI will be analyzed and strengthened as needed. The use of photographic evidence from community members will be encouraged. The results will be reported on a semi-annual basis and posted on the SKI/DSI websites. 109. In terms of empowerment, the project will explore the potential interest of expanding WUAs’ responsibilities beyond management of irrigation systems. Turkish WUAs have a long history of involvement in the management of irrigation infrastructure. Until relatively recently, however, O&M of these systems was centralized and imposed an increasing institutional and financial burden on the Government. Low billing and Page 43 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) collection ratios, inefficient water use by famers, no capex recovery, and lack of incentives for farmers to maintain the infrastructure were some of the key factors that led the GoT to hand over O&M responsibilities to WUAs in the early 1990s, with World Bank support. Consequently, the recovery rate for O&M costs increased from less than 40 percent to more than 80 percent, and water overuse and the resulting negative environmental impacts (for example, salinity) have gradually decreased (GWP 2013).77 Building on the demonstrated management capacity of WUAs, the project will explore the possibility of expanding their responsibilities to other areas such as the monitoring of treated wastewater effluent quality made available by the SKI, and outreach to local water users, specifically socially vulnerable persons, to obtain feedback on the rehabilitation and modernization of the irrigation schemes. V. GRIEVANCE REDRESS SERVICES 110. Grievance Redress. Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected by a project supported by the World Bank may submit complaints to existing project-level grievance mechanisms or the Bank’s Grievance Redress Service (GRS). The GRS ensures that complaints received are promptly reviewed in order to address project-related concerns. Project affected communities and individuals may submit their complaint to the Bank’s independent Accountability Mechanism (AM). The AM houses the Inspection Panel, which determines whether harm occurred, or could occur, as a result of Bank non-compliance with its policies and procedures, and the Dispute Resolution Service, which provides communities and borrowers with the opportunity to address complaints through dispute resolution. Complaints may be submitted to the AM at any time after concerns have been brought directly to the attention of Bank Management and after Management has been given an opportunity to respond. For information on how to submit complaints to the Bank’s Grievance Redress Service (GRS), please visit http://www.worldbank.org/GRS. For information on how to submit complaints to the Bank’s Accountability Mechanism, please visit https://accountability.worldbank.org. VI. KEY RISKS 111. The overall residual project risk is rated Substantial given the substantial political and governance, macroeconomic, environmental and social, fiduciary and stakeholder risks. Other risks, including technical and institutional capacity for implementation risks, are considered Moderate. Only the Substantial risks and their mitigation measures are described below. 112. Residual Political and governance risks are considered Substantial. Türkiye’s complex water sector governance framework, which involve multiple entities with overlapping mandates for some functions at national, local, and river basin levels, poses a risk to efficient project coordination and implementation. Although the draft Water Law is expected to address some of the institutional challenges, it has been under Government review since 2018 and it is unclear when it will be approved. While ILBANK, larger metropolitan municipalities, and DSI have experience in planning and implementing large-scale infrastructure investment projects (such as, municipal water supply, wastewater treatment plants, and irrigation and drainage systems), 77 https://www.gwp.org/en/learn/KNOWLEDGE_RESOURCES/Case_Studies/Mediterranean--Middle-East/Türkiye-Transfer-of-irrigation- management-to-water-users-associations-57/. Page 44 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) the operating modality that involves these institutions in one operation requires close coordination and agreement on various aspects (for example, design and location of reuse sub-projects) is new to these institutions. Thus, the project will support more effective coordination and engagement with key stakeholders during implementation through: (a) periodic project coordination meetings, and (b) development of templates for Wastewater Reuse Protocol Agreements between DSI and participating SKIs, to optimize the design of all treatment, reuse, and irrigation systems as well as to ensure effective O&M of the facilities. The main political risks relate to the need to ensure continued ownership and commitment to project objectives at the local level, regardless of changes in political leadership. Mitigation measures for these risks will include efforts to reestablish support for the main project activities soon after high-level changes occur through extensive stakeholder engagement and knowledge sharing activities to ensure exposure to global and local good practices. 113. Residual Macroeconomic risk is considered Substantial. There are three main macroeconomic risks for the project: (a) a challenging macro-economic outlook and any further significant depreciation of the currency that could raise already elevated construction costs and foreign exchange risks faced by contractors and SKIs; (b) increased supply-side constraints due to heightened pricing uncertainties that could lead to delays in project delivery; and (c) further currency depreciation that could heighten foreign exchange risks of metropolitan municipalities, put pressure on their already stretched budget, and lead to debt service problems. This risk is partially mitigated by ILBANK’s guarantee as a financial intermediary. ILBANK also has an option of using partial currency conversion swaps offered by World Bank Treasury at any time during project implementation to hedge foreign exchange risks. The macro risks should be mitigated by returning to a macro policy framework supporting macro stabilization, and implementation of ongoing corporate debt restructuring. The World Bank will continue to conduct macro-financial analysis, maintain policy dialogue with economic agencies, and offer technical assistance as requested by the Government. 114. Environment and Social risks are considered Substantial. These risks are discussed in the section on environmental and social risks above. 115. Residual Fiduciary risks are Substantial. The risks and mitigation measures are discussed in Annex 1. Implementation Arrangements and Support Plan. 116. Residual Stakeholder risks are Substantial. Stakeholder risks are mainly associated with the multiple beneficiary groups and stakeholders involved in the development, planning, O&M, and management of the proposed investments, especially given the limited prior direct collaboration among some of the key stakeholders. They include: (a) the SKIs of project metropolitan municipalities; (b) ILBANK and DSI; and (c) beneficiaries such as the population that will eventually benefit from treated wastewater, farmers that would eventually use reclaimed wastewater for farming, and their customers. The project preparation process has been instrumental in bringing together key stakeholders, such as DSI and ILBANK, to work in close collaboration in project design, and efforts will be made to maintain this engagement throughout project implementation. Design and construction of WWTPs under Component A will be coordinated by ILBANK (responsible for managing planning and construction), and the SKIs (the operators), and properly sequenced as needed. Stakeholder Engagement Plans of DSI will include outreach to potential and actual beneficiaries to promote broad understanding and buy-in to project interventions and ensure citizen engagement in project design to promote acceptability and sustainable uptake. Given the number of stakeholders involved, however, the rating remains Substantial. Page 45 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) .

ME IO Table SPACE Page 58 of 85 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) Page 59 of 85 o The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) ANNEX 1: Implementation Arrangements and Support Plan COUNTRY: Türkiye Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project 1. The project will be implemented through two main agencies at the central level, DSI and ILBANK, and by the respective water and wastewater utilities (SKIs) and WUAs at the local levels. There will be two Loan Agreements at the central level: Loan A with ILBANK as the borrower, with the guarantee of the GoT through MoTF, and Loan B, with MoTF as the borrower. The Debt Law describes the procedures for international borrowing in the Republic of Türkiye. The Debt Law classifies the international borrowing under three categories: allocation, on-lending, and guarantee. The Debt Law authorizes the MoTF to allocate foreign-financed loans to DSI. 2. Loan A with ILBANK. Under Loan A, ILBANK will be the borrower as a financial intermediary for relevant activities outlined in the project description, with the GoT guarantee. Loan proceeds will finance activities relating to Subcomponents defined in the Component description in this PAD, and as will be defined in the Legal Agreement and the POM. ILBANK will on-lend the loan proceeds to water and wastewater administrations (SKIs) through individual sub-financing agreements. 3. ILBANK is a state-owned municipal development and investment bank based in Ankara, affiliated institution to the MoEUCC. The project will be implemented through an existing PMU established under ILBANK’s International Relations Department, as is the case under the ongoing Sustainable Cities series of projects and the MSIP in refugee-affected areas financed through IBRD loans. ILBANK has experience with managing implementation of municipal infrastructure investments as a financial intermediary and has demonstrated its capacity for managing World Bank loans through the now closed MSP (2004–2016) and the ongoing Projects. 4. Loan B with the MoTF. Under Loan B, the MoTF will be the borrower. The MoTF will allocate the loan proceeds to DSI to implement activities related to Subcomponents defined in the Component description in this PAD, and as will be defined in the Legal Agreement and the POM. 5. DSI has a long history with the World Bank, is currently working with the World Bank, and is familiar with the World Bank systems and procedures. It is the implementing agency for the ongoing Türkiye Irrigation Modernization Project (TIMP) (P158418) approved in January 2019 and was also involved with previous World Bank-financed lending operations completed in the 1990s. DSI is also one of the implementing agencies of the Türkiye Resilient Landscape Integration Project (TULIP) (P172562), implemented under the World Bank’s new ESF. However, it will be important to strengthen DSI’s capacity for application of the World Bank’s ESF because this will be the second operation implemented by the agency that would use this framework. 6. Municipalities and SKIs. At the subnational level, Component A of the project will be implemented by SKIs under respective municipalities, with support from ILBANK. A PIU will be established for the project in the participating SKIs to be responsible for implementation of the WWTP subcomponents with technical support from ILBANK. Page 60 of 85 The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) 7. WUAs. WUAs will be responsible for O&M of irrigation systems after they are completed and transferred by DSI. Implementation Arrangements under ILBANK 8. The project will be implemented by an existing PMU established under ILBANK’s International Relations Department, as is the case under the ongoing Sustainable Cities series of projects at the central level, and by PIUs to be set up within the participating municipalities and/or SKIs at the local level. ILBANK establishes the creditworthiness of all local authorities in Türkiye, provides loans (or grants for small municipalities and local authorities) and guarantees, channels funding from IFIs, and carries out all required due diligence. ILBANK’s performance on past and ongoing operations has consistently been rated in the ‘Satisfactory’ range by the World Bank in its Implementation Status and Results Reports and its Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs). The ILBANK PMU shall be responsible for day-to-day management and implementation of the Component A and Subcomponent D1 of the project, in accordance with the provisions of the POM, including the responsibility for FM, provision of procurement implementation support/procurement implementation, disbursement, monitoring of environmental and social risk management, reporting, and M&E of the project activities. The existing PMU has qualified staff responsible for management of core project management functions, including procurement, FM, and environmental and social risk management in line with ESF requirements,78 and M&E. Implementation Arrangements under DSI 9. DSI has an established PMT that will be responsible for managing all aspects of project implementation. This PMT is currently managing the ongoing TIMP within DSI; however, its capacity will be strengthened to be able to manage implementation of both projects. The PMT through DSI’s relevant departments will manage, among others, finalization of designs, consultations, contracting, construction supervision, operations and maintenance, fiduciary management, citizen engagement, and management of the ESF compliance aspects for this project. The PMT is headed by DSI’s Head of the Department of Irrigation, who will serve as Project Director for both projects. The PMT will include professional staff from all the DSI departments that are relevant to project implementation. The three main implementing departments are the Department of Irrigation, the Department of Potable Water and Wastewater, and the Department of Operations and Maintenance. Other relevant departments include (a) Department of Strategy Development; (b) Department of Land Consolidation and On-Farm Development Services; (c) Department of Real Estate and Expropriation; (d) Department of Dams and (e) Department of Investigation, Planning and Allocation. 10. In addition to DSI’s professional staff, the PMT will include competitively recruited experts in the areas where DSI staff may not be able to designate sufficient staff. These areas include environmental and social aspects, FM, procurement, citizen engagement, and M&E. The implementation of the project will be aligned with the regular administration procedures of DSI; therefore, no project-specific Implementation Unit will be established. 11. While most of the PMT will be located at the DSI headquarters in Ankara, it will include regional staff located in each of the DSI regional directorates corresponding to the project-financed schemes for 78Responsibilities for management of environmental and social risk will be outlined in relevant instruments prepared in line with the requirements of the ESF and will also include the municipal-level PIUs and contractors. Page 61 of 85 The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) both the WWTPs with reuse for irrigation and the irrigation modernization schemes. Each relevant DSI Regional Directorate will have a Coordinator and an Environmental and Social Focal Point, who are members of the PMT. The procurement for all project-financed schemes will be conducted from the DSI headquarters, but the PMT staff from regional directorates will be responsible for regular supervision of construction, O&M, and the social and environmental aspects of the activities. The operational modalities are described in the POM. At the field level, the PMT will work closely with WUAs at all stages of implementation, to ensure that local knowledge is able to enhance the final design, social acceptance, and economic potential of the modernization activities in the financed schemes. 12. POM. By project effectiveness, DSI and ILBANK will develop a detailed POM for project implementation, setting out: (a) policies and procedures relating to implementation of project components, (b) FM and procurement arrangements and procedures, (c) environmental and social risk management obligations and procedures, and (d) coordination arrangements under the project. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT 13. The project FM arrangements are satisfactory to the World Bank. Both implementing entities have experience in implementing World Bank-financed projects. The current FM arrangements utilized by ILBANK for the implementation of SCP1, SCP2 and SCP2 AF and MSIP and by DSI for the TIMP will be used for the proposed project. 14. Implementing Entity. The project will be implemented by ILBANK and DSI for specified subcomponents as indicated above. ILBANK was first established as Belediyeler Bankasi in 1933 to finance the reconstruction activities of municipalities. Iller Bankasi law (Law 4759) has been updated in 2011, making it a joint stock development and investment bank that is subject to the banking law. Its objectives are to meet the financing needs of special provincial authorities, municipalities, and their affiliated organizations and of local administrative associations and provide consultancy services to these organizations on urban projects. ILBANK is the affiliated institution of the MoEUCC. The shareholders of ILBANK are the municipalities and special provincial administrations. Law 5779 on Allotments of General Budget Revenues to be allocated to special provincial authorities and municipalities (2008) requires two percent of total tax allotment revenues distributed by the MoTF through ILBANK to be deducted to contribute as capital to ILBANK. 15. As mentioned above, ILBANK has a PMU under its International Relations Department responsible for foreign-financed projects including SCP1, SCP2, SCP2 AF, and MSIP. The PMU is organized according to function and its FM department is responsible for such arrangements under all loans. They will continue to have this responsibility under the Project. ILBANK will provide technical support to the related water and sewerage utilities in appraising investments. ILBANK will provide funding for the defined investment projects from the World Bank loan. ILBANK will provide implementation support to participating municipalities/SKIs who will be responsible for the procurement of all activities under Component A except for Subcomponent A3.3. The eventual contracts will be signed between the SKI and the firm. Payments to the suppliers/contractors/consultants will be registered directly by ILBANK upon submission of acceptable approval documents. The PMU in ILBANK will be responsible for the management of the Designated Account, and project accounting and reporting. 16. The MoTF will sign the Loan Agreement with the World Bank for the part that will be implemented by DSI. The Debt Law describes the procedures for international borrowing in the Republic of Türkiye. The Page 62 of 85 The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) Debt Law classifies the international borrowing under three categories: allocation, on-lending, and guarantee. The Debt Law authorizes the MoTF to allocate foreign-financed loans to general budget institutions. Although DSI is a special budget institution, the specific reference to DSI in the Debt Law enables MoTF to allocate loans for DSI. 17. As mentioned above, DSI has a PMT housed in its General Directorate of Irrigation (Sulama Daire Baskanligi, (GDI) that is functioning well under the TIMP. The PMT has DSI staff assigned for the FM of the project. The capacity will be enhanced with a dedicated FM consultant with satisfactory experience and qualifications if deemed necessary. The GDI will again assume the leading role in the implementation of current project. 18. Budgeting. The investments that are proposed to be financed by the IBRD loan must be in the Government’s investment program. The SBO has confirmed that the proposed investments by DSI are included in the investment plan, and also ILBANK’s investment for Konya (KOSKİ) is included the investment program. The requirements of the PFMC Law are applicable to DSI for the World Bank- financed projects. In addition to having the overall investment approved by the SBO, DSI has to project its expected investment expenditures annually and have a budget allocation for such expenditures in the annual budget law. The project budget expenditures are considered within the overall budget ceiling of DSI. The project was prepared as a Framework (or ‘Umbrella’) project based on a long list of eligible subprojects under each component, where the specific subprojects would be confirmed after approval. 19. Staffing. The PMU at the ILBANK has a dedicated FM unit responsible for FM functions of all foreign-financed projects. There are currently 17 staff working in this department and ILBANK will assign at least one FM specialist to work solely on the FM aspects of the WCEIP. The qualifications and experience of the current staff are satisfactory to the World Bank. They have worked in the implementation of the MSP, its additional financing and currently working for SCP1, SCP2, SCP2 AF, and MSIP. The experience they have gained in the implementation of these projects will be utilized in conducting the FM arrangements of the WCEIP. DSI staff working on the FM of the current TIMP has satisfactory qualifications and experience. DSI will support the current capacity with an additional staff/consultant after the project becomes effective if deemed necessary. Current FM staff working on TIMP will work on FM procedures during project preparation. 20. Accounting Procedures and Internal Controls. ILBANK has a web-based information system (IL_BIS) that links all departments of the institution, allowing them to execute, monitor, and report using the same data source. All the regional offices are also connected to the central IL_BIS system. Project accounting for the current loans is integrated into this system using sub-accounts that were created under the World Bank’s main chart of accounts. The PMU staff prepares the payment orders and the accounting entries into the World Bank’s main accounting system are made by the Accounting Department’s staff. Unaudited Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) are also generated automatically through the system. The WCEIP will also rely on the same systems and the accounting and reporting for the project will be fully integrated into the IL_BIS system. ILBANK will conduct the necessary modifications/additions to the IL_BIS system and these arrangements are expected to be in place before project effectiveness. 21. ILBANK has robust systems, manuals, and guidelines regulating the internal controls environment. The accounting and reporting systems at ILBANK are geared toward producing statements and information as required by Turkish laws and regulations. Additionally, ILBANK has developed and executed specific internal control procedures for the implementation of the foreign-financed projects including the Page 63 of 85 The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) SCP Program and these procedures are clearly defined in the project FM Manual which is available in the ILBANK website. ILBANK will prepare an FM Manual for WCEIP early during implementation. The FM Manual of current projects implemented by ILBANK will be taken as the basis for WCEIP FM Manual. The PMU at ILBANK has been utilizing detailed checklists that are completed and signed by the relevant staff before processing payments. Those checklists include financial controls on advance payments made for works in progress, financial controls on payments to individual consultants and corporate consultants, financial controls on works progress payments, and financial controls on goods purchases. These checklists with a few modifications to enable funding source identification will also be utilized for WCEIP. 22. The ILBANK-implemented part of WCEIP will disburse through sub-loan agreements that will be made between ILBANK and qualifying utility companies. The utilities will submit the payment requests to the PMU after verifying completeness of all documentation. The payment will be made directly from the Designated Accounts to the constructor’s bank account. 23. The project transactions that will be made by the DSI will be processed through the Public Expenditure and Accounting Information System (KBS). Departments responsible for implementation in DSI will send payment orders together with the supporting documents to the Ministry of Treasury and Finance Accounting Office (MOF-AO) in DSI. The accountant at the MOF-AO will enter the transactions into the KBS and will approve the payment order for processing from the Designated Account at the Central Bank of Türkiye. The Central Bank will register the payment from the Designated Account based on the approval of the MOF-AO accountant. The transactions will be entered into KBS in Turkish lira equivalent and will also be recorded under the account code dedicated to the project. 24. The PMU will maintain detailed accounts of the project in foreign currency. DSI has purchased and customized LOGO accounting software and actively uses it for recording project transactions separately for the IBRD and grant parts under IMP. DSI will integrate WCEIP to the LOGO software. The software includes adequate security levels and facilitates for reporting in foreign currency and the IFRs as well as the end-of-the-year financial reports are generated automatically from the system. The accounting entries will be based on the information received from the Central Bank payment confirmations. 25. For the DSI-implemented part of the project, the relevant departments under the coordination of the PMT will be responsible for all stages of procurement. The departments will plan for their investments included within the scope of the project and liaise with the PMT and the Strategy Development General Directorate to ensure budget is allocated for their planned expenditures. The technical specifications of the planned investments will be prepared by the related department and shared with the PMT for their coordination and communication with the Bank. All relevant departments, including the DI will conduct the procurement of the investment in line with the Procurement Regulations and will sign the agreement with the consultant/supplier/constructing company. The relevant departments will share copies of the agreement with the PMT and the Foreign Loans Department. The related department will also share a copy of the agreement, technical specifications, and all supporting documentation with the Regional Directorate where the investment will be done. The regional directorates will be responsible for controlling the progress and approving progress payment requests. The progress payment requests will be sent to the related department of the General Directorate for next stage of controls and processing for payment. The progress payment requests will be rechecked at the related department. The payment request from the Designated Account will be prepared by the PMT and sent to the central accounting office of DSI for processing. The system described is utilized by DSI for TIMP and functioning satisfactorily. Page 64 of 85 The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) Both ILBANK and DSI have functioning Internal Audit Departments and the project transactions will be considered under their regular systems audits. 26. Funds flow. There will be two Designated Accounts for the project, one will be under the name of ILBANK at a commercial bank and one at the Central Bank of Türkiye for DSI. MoTF will endorse the opening of the Designated Account one at the Central Bank of Türkiye for DSI. All payments to the contractors, suppliers, and consultants will either be made directly from the loan/grant account or from the Designated Accounts with the authorization of the responsible personnel. Traditional disbursement methods will be utilized. 27. Reporting and auditing. ILBANK will prepare unaudited IFRs for the project following the same format utilized for SCP1 and SCP2. DSI will likewise use the same format as the IMP. The agreed formats of the IFRs will be attached to the negotiation minutes. The implementing entities will prepare project financial statements separately for the part of the project they are implementing. Consolidated financial statements will not be required as there will be two Designated Accounts and strict differentiation between the project transactions of ILBANK and DSI. As part of the World Bank’s auditing requirements, project financial statements will be subject to external and independent auditing. The first set of audit reports will be submitted to the World Bank before June 30 of the year following the calendar year in which the first disbursement from the loan or grant has been made. The project financial statements will be audited by the MoTF Controllers in accordance with International Auditing Standards. The ToRs for the audit will be attached to the minutes of negotiations. ILBANK will also be required to submit its audited entity financial statements prepared in accordance with Turkish Accounting Standards (which are fully compatible with International Financial Reporting Standards). 28. The project financial statements are required to be made publicly available in accordance with the World Bank Guidelines. Table 1.1 identifies the audit reports and their due dates: Table 1.1. Audit Reports and Due Dates Type of Audit Report Due Date ILBANK Entity Financial Statements Within six months after the end of each calendar year and also at the closing of the project Project Financial Statements (PFS) for ILBANK Within six months after the end of each calendar year, and also at the closing of the project Project Financial Statements (PFS) for DSI Within six months after the end of each calendar year and also at the closing of the project 29. There are no outstanding audit reports related to the project implemented by ILBANK or DSI. The auditors have issued clean audit opinions on the project financial statements of SCP and SCP2 and IMP for the year ended December 31, 2021. 30. Disbursement arrangements. The project will use traditional disbursement methods: designated accounts, reimbursements, direct payments, and special commitments. The minimum application size for payments directly from the Loan Account, for issuance of special commitments and for reimbursements, as well as the Designated Accounts ceilings, will be provided in the Disbursement and Financial Information Letters. Eligible expenditures paid from the Designated Accounts will be documented to the World Bank through SOEs. Full documentation in support of SOEs would be retained by DSI for at least two years after the World Bank has received the audit report for the fiscal year in which the last Page 65 of 85 The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) withdrawal from the Loan Account was made. This information will be made available for review during supervision by World Bank staff and for annual audits. PROCUREMENT 31. Applicable regulations. The project will follow the World Bank Procurement Regulations for IPF Borrowers (November 2020 version). A General Procurement Notice will be published on the World Bank’s external website and United Nations Development Business online. 32. Anti-Corruption Guidelines. The World Bank’s ‘Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants’, (revised as of July 1, 2016) (Anticorruption Guidelines), will apply to the project. 33. Project Procurement Strategy for Development (PPSD). The Procurement Regulations requires the Borrower to develop a PPSD for the Project. The PPSD(s) - a framework PPSD in the case of ILBANK have been prepared by both project implementing entities based on paragraphs 4.1 and 4.2 of the Procurement Regulations applicable for the Project and agreed by the Bank. The additional feasibility studies required for the associated activities under Subcomponent B3 and participation of municipalities and utilities that will be selected according to the eligibility criteria under Subcomponent A1 preclude an estimation of the sub-borrowers and their procurement requirements at the appraisal stage, thus rendering it impossible for ILBANK to share individual Procurement Plans and PPSDs that will be developed by respective participating municipalities and utilities. Thus, supplementary PPSD(s) will be prepared by the participating municipalities/SKIs when the subprojects to be financed under Subcomponent A1 are identified and become clear. These supplementary PPSDs are also relevant and required in the case of activities of Subcomponent B3 whose financing is dependent on the outcome of the Feasibility Studies conducted for the same. The project will build on the existing implementation arrangements of DSI (however, in this case additional DSI departments will also be responsible for procurement implementation) and ILBANK similar to their ongoing operations. According to the World Bank’s procurement assessment at national and agency level, DSI and ILBANK have been found as well- performing institutions in Türkiye with high engineering capacities. Considering the limited implementation duration of the project, the participating municipalities/utilities - when identified will establish dedicated project implementation units comprised of procurement and technical experts. These experts will be involved in the selection process of the design review and supervision consultants, works contractors, good suppliers and management of concluded contracts. The participating municipalities/utilities will hire experts experienced in the procurement and management of the contracts in the Bank financed projects, if such staff already does not exist in their teams. 34. In terms of procurement capacity assessment, DSI, ILBANK, and the participating municipalities/utilities, as government institutions, follow the national regulations on the procurement policies and procedures and both at national and agency level, these are well and efficiently applied. 35. Staffing and contract management capacity. DSI has 17 separate departments, with 1,826 staff at headquarters and 20,178 staff at 26 regional offices. About 29.3 percent of the total 22,004 staff are technical staff with 1,035 staff at headquarters and 5,413 regional staff. About 1,608 of the total 6,448 technical staff are civil engineers responsible for design, construction, and maintenance of investment works in 2022. The procurement activities under the project will be conducted by the relevant department/s of DSI in line with their areas of responsibilities, except for the departments without Page 66 of 85 The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) purchasing units whose procurements will be handled by the DI. The DI will provide hands-on implementation support to the other departments in WB procurement implementation. Additionally, regional directorates will supervise the construction works for the major works contracts. 36. The ILBANK PMU, as being responsible for the coordination and management of the project, has four separate units: Business Development Unit, Contract Management Unit, FM Unit, and Technical Management Unit. The Contract Management Unit will be mainly responsible for the coordination of the procurement activities in the scope of the project. This unit includes one contract management director and eight procurement-related staff. The ILBANK PMU has vast experience on Bank procurement procedures having managed and coordinated the completed MSP1 and MSP-AF projects. The ILBANK PMU is still in charge of the ongoing SCP1, SCP2 financed by the Bank and MSIP financed/administered by the Bank. Also, the FM Unit and Technical Management Unit will support the Contract Management Unit for project-related procurement processes. Because the participating municipalities/utilities are not yet identified, no assessment was made for their capability for staffing and contract management. However, recent experience from projects implemented by ILBANK shows that strong sub-borrower staffing capacity is rare, and staff are not dedicated to dealing with project procurement activities. Thus, together with the identification of participating municipalities/utilities, ILBANK will be conducting an assessment on staffing and implementation capacity needs and identify the detailed risks and related mitigation measures for the sub-loans to be financed under the project. 37. Past performance. During 2020–2021, DSI’s DPI has successfully concluded the contract awards of all irrigation modernization contracts under World Bank-financed TIMP (P158418) similar to the ones under the scope of the Project. Regarding the project’s scope, the number of contracts (three major contracts as irrigation modernization schemes) and the overall costing, DSI is expected to handle procurements under the project in a satisfactory manner. ILBANK has also managed and awarded quite a large number of works and services contracts both through the Public Procurement Law and the World Bank’s Procurement Regulations. ILBANK has long experience with managing implementation of municipal infrastructure investments as a financial intermediary and has demonstrated its capacity for managing World Bank loans through the MSP (2006–2016), the ongoing Sustainable Cities Series of Projects and the MSIP. 38. Market analysis and contracting strategy. In the last five years, similar irrigation contracts were awarded to 18 local firms for civil works. Participation of the international bidders was allowed for all of the awarded contracts but the participation by foreign firms is very limited with only one foreign bidder in two tenders of the TIMP (P158418). The activities under the irrigation-related contracts in nature do not attract foreign participation, as they are not complex, geographically distributed and at remote areas, and do not require international expertise although the contract sizes are relatively high. The market sounding made for Subcomponent A1 concluded that there is a highly competitive local and international market in the wastewater sector who may be qualified alone or in association with others for the proposed contracts under Subcomponent A1 as further evidenced through tender participations in World Bank-financed Municipal Services Project - MSP-1 and MSP-2. Also, it has been observed in the procurements of World Bank-financed MSP-1, MSP-2, and SCP projects that the interest of the foreign bidders was very limited in these tenders. Nonetheless, the indicative country thresholds for use of national/international market approach shall be used for procurements under Subcomponent A1. 39. Procurement Plan and Procurement Tracking. In accordance with paragraph 5.9 of the Procurement Regulations, the World Bank’s STEP system will be used to prepare, clear, and update the Page 67 of 85 The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) Procurement Plan and conduct all procurement transactions for the project together with the provisions stipulated in the Loan Agreement. ILBANK/DSI will create the procurement plan through STEP prior to initiating any procurement. The PPSD and the underlying Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect actual project implementation needs. The Procurement Plan/s under Subcomponents A1 and B3 will be discussed and agreed with the World Bank when the sub projects are identified/feasibility studies are completed. Some of the major activities under the DSI Procurement Plan are as follows: Estimated Signed Contract Procurement procurement Market Review Contract Completion Activity Description: Reference No Selection Notice/ Approach Method Method Invitation (Planned (Planned Date Date) Date) Pazarcık Kartalkaya Dam Left Bank Request for TWCEIP-B1- Open - Irrigation Scheme Bids (RFB) Post Jun.24 Oct.24 Oct.28 YAP-01 National Modernization Works Project Pazarcık Kartalkaya Dam Right Bank Request for TWCEIP-B1- Open - Irrigation Scheme Bids (RFB) Post Jun.25 Oct.25 Oct.29 YAP-02 National Modernization Works Project Sarimsakli Dam Request for Irrigation Scheme TWCEIP-B1- Open - Bids (RFB) Post Aug.24 Dec.24 Apr.29 Modernization YAP-03 National Works Project Karakuyu (Dombay) Pumping Irrigation Request for TWCEIP-B1- Open - Scheme Bids (RFB) Post Oct.24 Feb.25 Feb.28 YAP-04 National Modernization Works Project Procurement of Irrigation Hydrants Open - Request for TWCEIP-B2`- with Water meters Internatio Bids (RFB) Prior Nov.23 Mar.24 Mar.26 MAL-01 (Supply and nal Goods Installation) Part 1 Procurement of Irrigation Hydrants Open - Request for TWCEIP-B2- with Water meters Internatio Bids (RFB) Prior Jul.24 Nov.24 Nov.25 MAL-02 (Supply and nal Goods Installation) Part 2 40. Special procurement arrangements. Based on the findings of the PPSD and performance of DSI on past contracts, National Procurement Procedures will be applied for all procurements up to US$ 115 million under Subcomponents B1 when approaching the local market as specified in paragraphs 5.3 through 5.6 of the Procurement Regulations, subject to the provisions provided in the Procurement Plan and through the use of the sample bidding documents agreed between the World Bank and DSI. 41. Other procurement methods. The methods defined in the Procurement Plan will be followed for the procurement of goods and non-consulting services (including logistics and organization services for Page 68 of 85 The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) training and workshops) such as Request for Quotation procedures in accordance with the provisions of section 6.7 of the Procurement Regulations, where appropriate, and other methods as agreed in the Procurement Plan. 42. Selection of consultants. The methods defined in the Procurement Plan will be followed for the selection of the consultants, such as Quality- and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS), Selection Based on Consultants’ Qualification (CQS) in line with sections 7.3 and 7.12 of the Procurement Regulations, and other methods as agreed in the Procurement Plan. For the employment of experts, selection of individual consultants may be used. Subject to justification in terms of economy, efficiency, and equal opportunity to all qualified eligible consultants, the Direct Selection method for consultant firms and individuals may be used. ToRs for FM, audit, procurement, or legal contracts financed by the project shall be subject to the World Bank’s review. 43. Domestic preference as specified under paragraph 5.51 of the Procurement Regulations will not be applicable for contracts identified in the Procurement Plan. 44. Risk and mitigation measures. Overall project risk for procurement is rated as substantial. After mitigation measures are implemented, the residual risk would be moderate. The assessment will be recorded in the Procurement Risk Assessment and Management System of the World Bank. Table 1.2.

The World Bank will review the procurement arrangements performed by the implementing agencies, including contract packaging, applicable procedures, and the scheduling of the procurement processes, for their conformity with the Legal Agreement. Those procurements did not have ex ante due diligence by the World Bank will be subject to ex post due diligence on a sampling basis in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph 4 of Annex II to the Procurement Regulations. A post review of the procurement documents will normally be undertaken annually during the World Bank’s supervision mission/s or the World Bank may request to review any particular contract at any time. In such cases, the project implementing entities shall provide the World Bank the relevant documentation for its review. 46. Complaint review. The procurement complaints other than covered under Annex III of the Procurement Regulations are to be handled by the project implementing entities in accordance with the procedures agreed by the World Bank and stipulated in the POM. Immediately upon receipt, the complaints will be recorded in the STEP complaint module by project implementing entities. Project implementing entities will not proceed with the next stage/phase of the procurement process, including with awarding a contract without satisfactory resolution of the complaint(s). 47. Operational costs will not be considered under World Bank procurement implementation. WORLD BANK PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION SUPPORT PLAN 48. The Implementation Support Plan (ISP) is tailored to the specific context and characteristics of the project, based on the dispersed geographic scale of investments, and existing capacity of the implementing agencies and arrangements. The ISP will be reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains fit for purpose and responsive to the project’s implementation support needs over its lifetime. 49. Project Launch Workshop. A project launch workshop will be held soon after project approval. It will bring all project stakeholders together to ensure that the project scope, design, process, and Page 71 of 85 The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) responsibilities are understood. This workshop will be coordinated by MoTF and organized jointly with DSI, ILBANK and the World Bank. 50. Implementation support missions. The project would be supervised at least twice a year and the recommendations of such supervisions would be presented to DSI and ILBANK and recorded in an Aide Memoire. The World Bank would be represented by a task team leader, supported by a team of experts with various skills as needed, including fiduciary (procurement and FM), social and environmental risk management, M&E, and technical specialists. The goal would be to (a) undertake required policy dialogue with the GoT, MoAF/DSI, ILBANK/MoEUCC, and municipalities/SKIs, related to the project and the sector and (b) coordinate with other development partners and stakeholders. 51. The semiannual supervision missions and short/ follow-up technical missions as needed in specific areas, will focus on the following areas: (a) Strategic support. Supervision missions will meet with DSI PMT, ILBANK PMU, and relevant SKI/municipality PIU representatives to (i) review progress on the project’s activities; (ii) discuss strategic alignment of the project’s different activities, especially at the planning level, between the relevant stakeholders; and (iii) evaluate progress on cross-cutting issues such as M&E, training, communication, knowledge exchange, innovation, dissemination of project results and experiences, and coordination between the relevant stakeholders. (b) Technical support. Supervision will concentrate on ensuring the technical quality of bidding documents, ToRs, evaluation reports, construction plans, products delivered by consultants, and investment activities/targets, working in close collaboration with ILBANK and the design review and construction supervision consultants. During construction and commissioning, technical supervision will be provided to ensure that technical contractual obligations are met. Regular site visits will be carried out during project implementation and will involve technical specialists from the World Bank, DSI, ILBANK, and consultant teams as needed. (c) Fiduciary support. Periodic supervision of procurement and FM support will be carried out by the World Bank semiannually to (i) perform desk reviews of project IFRs and audit reports, following up on any issues raised by auditors, as appropriate; (ii) assess the performance of control systems and arrangements; (iii) update the FM rating in the FM Implementation Support and Status Report as needed; (iv) provide training and guidance on carrying out procurement processes in compliance with the applicable Procurement Regulations and Anticorruption Guidelines and the POM; (v) review procurement documents of prior review contracts and provide timely feedback to the project implementing entities; (vi) carry out the post review of procurement actions; and (vii) help monitor project progress against the Procurement Plan and identified performance indicators of the contracts. (d) Environmental and social risk management support. The coordination that began during preparation will continue throughout project implementation, especially to ensure that the measures to address environmental and social risks and impacts are included in the works financed under the project through due diligence from applications of the site-specific ESIAs, ESMPs, and Resettlement Policy Framework and effective mitigation measures. Supervision from the World Bank environmental and social risk management specialists will take place at least twice a year. Page 72 of 85 The World Bank Municipal Services Improvement Project in Refugee Affected Areas (P169996) 52. Mid-term Review (MTR). An MTR of the project will be carried out about three and a half years into implementation to assess overall progress toward meeting the development objective and to address any changes to project design or implementation required to meet the objectives. 53. Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR). An ICR will be drafted by the Bank and the borrower within six months of project completion to satisfy accountability needs and provide lessons from completed operations. ICRs are tailored to enhance development effectiveness through a continuous process of self-evaluation, lesson learning and application, sharing of knowledge, and being accountable for results. The lessons learned from the ICR will improve the quality and effectiveness of similar WB operations, while borrower/stakeholder participation in the ICR process would inform design, preparation, and implementation of follow-up projects. 54. Implementation resource requirements. Table 1.2 reflects estimates of skill requirements, timing, and resource requirements over the life of the project. These projections are subject to modification as needed over the course of implementation. 55. Table 1.2.

Component A investments will finance construction of WWTPs in selected urban settlement areas. This component will be implemented by ILBANK, which presented a shortlist of metropolitan water and wastewater entities with high demand for modernization of WWTPs and potential for reuse of treated wastewater. The investment list, after finalizing this analysis, is indicative and includes construction and rehabilitation of WWTPs with tertiary treatment/disinfection processes to allow reuse of the treated effluent for irrigation or watering of green municipal areas. 2. Detailed GHG accounting analysis was performed only for the Konya WWTP, which has exhibited a high degree of preparedness and readiness regarding investment specifics. The total investment cost of Konya WWTP sub- project is estimated to be EUR 85 million. Thus, the detailed GHG Accounting Analysis done for Konya is extrapolated to the other WWTPs based on the following assumptions: • Emission reductions per year are estimated to be 74 percent of baseline emissions, based on the analysis for Konya WWTP, and • The proposed activities will contribute to a GHG emissions reduction by 121,068 tCO2e per year and result in a direct wastewater emissions reduction of 86.6 percent. 3. The results of the GHG Accounting Analysis for Konya are provided in table A3.1. They show the net emissions from the Konya WWTP expansion project, which is the difference between baseline emissions under a business-as-usual scenario and project gross emissions under the project implementation scenario. Net average annual emissions indicate yearly net emissions throughout the project life. The bulk of net emissions originate from sequestration of stationary CH4 emissions with other processes and fugitive gas emissions. Table A3.1. Summary Emissions Output for Konya WWTP Project Source of emission Project Gross Baseline Emissions Net Emissions Net Average Annual Emissions (tCO2-eq) (tCO2-eq) Emissions (tCO2-eq) (tCO2-eq) Emissions for 846,950 3,268,316 -2,421,366 -121,068 Wastewater Utility 4. Component B1. All calculations were performed using the FAO’s EX-ACT tool and the raw data were provided by the client. The areas for irrigation modernization have a warm temperate dry climate with high activity clay (HAC) soils with an implementation phase of 2 years and a capitalization phase of 18 years for a total economic life of 20 years. The area used to grow annual crops with modernized irrigation will be 30,396 ha. Perennial crop lands would increase from about 1,700 to above 10,000 ha. Fallow land would decrease from about 1,500 ha to 100 ha. Degraded land area would fall from about 200 ha to 0 ha, which will be used for growing crops. Moreover, under the project scenario, improved agricultural practices would be adopted. 5. To account emissions reduction from land use changes, cropping and land use patterns were analyzed for each of the project locations separately. To preserve the norm of conservatism in GHG accounting, it was assumed that changes from degraded and fallow land toward cultivation would first prioritize annual crops, Page 75 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) with any remaining newly cultivated land going to perennial crops. The results of GHG Accounting Analysis for Component B1 related to land use change are summarized in table A3.2. The emission reduction due to changes in cropping patterns and land use is estimated to be -1,160,830 tCO2-eq. Table A3.2. Emission reductions due to land use changes for Component B1 Schemes Project Gross Baseline Net Emissions Net Average Emissions Emissions (tCO2-eq) Annual Emissions (tCO2-eq) (tCO2-eq) (tCO2-eq) Karakuyu 106,300 246,100 -139,800 -6,990 (Dombay) Pazarcik Kartalkaya 169,210 964,760 -795,550 -39,778 Sarimsaklı 200,380 425,780 -225,400 -11,270 Total 475,890 1,636,640 -1,160,830 -58,042 6. In addition, the total annual electricity use for irrigation for the schemes is estimated to be 15,562 [1] MWh, which was entered into the “Electricity” module on the “Inputs” tab of the EX-ACT tool. The baseline scenario would result in baseline emissions of 2,778,318 tCO2-eq. The transformation of open channel irrigation systems to more water-efficient closed pressurized irrigation system will reduce non-beneficial water losses and conserve energy and this would result in gross project emission of 2,243,496 and net emissions of - 555,678tCO2-eq. Construction of the new irrigation infrastructure would be net emissive at 20,856 tCO2-eq. As a result, the irrigation activities, overall would see net emissions of -534,822 tCO2-eq. from reductions in electricity use (table A3.3). 7. For Component B2, a similar exercise was carried out for electricity use by irrigation schemes, where water meters would be installed, to estimate net emissions due to conservation of energy. A DSI evaluation report for one of the pilot metering sites indicates that electricity consumption declined from 695.3kW per hectare to 488.6 KW per hectare after metering implying an energy savings of about 30 percent. For a total area of 387,964 ha this would result in net emissions of -3,398,863tCO2-eq (table A3.3). Table A3.3. Emission reductions due to changes in electricity use Components Project Gross Baseline Net Emissions Net Annual Emissions over Emissions over over 20 years Emissions 20 years 20 years (tCO2-eq) (tCO2-eq) (tCO2-eq) (tCO2-eq) Component 2,243,496 2,778,318 -534,822 -26,741 B1 Component 7,930,680 11,329,543 -3,398,863 -169,943 B2 Total 10,174,176 14,107,861 -3,933,685 -196,684 8. In summary, the modernization of irrigation schemes under Component B1 will result in reduction of electricity used due to conservation of energy with transformation of open channel irrigation into closed pressurized systems and will yield net emissions of -534,822 tCO2-eq. Under Component B2, installation of Page 76 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) irrigation water meters is expected to reduce energy use by 30 percent, which will lead to net emissions of - 3,398,863tCO2-eq. for a total irrigation area of 387,964 ha over a 20-year period. 9. Whole Project. The results of the GHG accounting analysis for the overall project are summarized in table A3.4. The results indicate that the project overall has significant GHG emission reduction impacts. The generation of biogas from wastewater alone reduces GHG emissions by about 4,806,315 tCO2-eq over a 20- year period. Table A3.4.

Page 77 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) ANNEX 3: FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARY FINANCING ASSESSMENT FOR ILLER BANK A.S. (ILBANK)79 1. ILBANK (or the Bank) has a development and investment bank license and is a special-budget incorporated company. The Bank is subject to its special law (Law no. 6107) and Banking Law no. 5411 and it was established in 1933 as the Municipalities’ Bank to provide financing to the municipalities. In 1945, ILBANK expanded its tasks and its organization as a credit institution for the local authorities. The bank initially had two core functions, which have been carried out to date: a) Support urban development at the local level through technical assistance, grants, and loans; b) Transfer central budget tax revenues to the local authorities. 2. ILBANK is a unique institution and differs from other state and development banks. Its infrastructure investment funding to municipalities is included in the state’s annual investment program and requires feasibility studi(es) to be prepared and approved by the State Budget Office (SBO). 3. The shareholders and borrowers of the Bank are municipalities and local administrations, which exclusively make up its client base. Every municipality and local administration unit throughout the country, small and large, holds one share in ILBANK. The nominal capital of the Bank is currently TRY 45 billion, which a Decision of the President of Türkiye can increase. ILBANK offers medium and long-term cash loans and guarantees, conducts research, provides project development and consultancy services, serves as an insurance agency, coordinates with and obtains financial resources from domestic and foreign financial institutions, develops special and urban infrastructure projects, and executes or arranges real estate transactions. 4. ILBANK is an incorporated company affiliated with the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization, and Climate Change (MoEUCC). According to ILBANK’s law of incorporation (No: 6107) and company charter, it is an affiliated entity with MoEUCC. This contrasts with other public development banks in Türkiye where the ownership function is carried out by the Ministry of Treasury and Finance (MOTF). The MoEUCC exercises its control by appointing four of the seven-member board of directors and two audit committee members. MoEUCC can also assign the implementation of special urban projects to ILBANK. Accordingly, amending clauses have been added to ILBANK’s law enabling it to finance these from its own sources. The bank has undertaken several urban transformation projects across Türkiye. 5. Given its mission, business model and organization, ILBANK is uniquely suited to perform the required tasks under the Project. In addition, (i) the lack of access to commercial finance by municipal borrowers due to their financial limitations (i.e., low creditworthiness) and administrative capacity constraints; (ii) shortage of long-term funds in local currency offered by the domestic financial sector; and (iii) the insufficiency of alternative funding mechanisms, including capital markets, project financing and impact finance mechanisms, underpin the viability of the role ILBANK plays as the lender of choice in municipal finance. 6. ILBANK’s financing is used for achieving objectives related to specific infrastructure sectors, such as urban development, climate resilience, water supply and treatment, waste management, urban mobility, and 79 This Annex provides background information on ILBANK and a summary evaluation of ILBANK against the Bank’s standard criteria for financial intermediary financing (FIF) listed in OP 10.00 (Investment Project Financing). Page 78 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) energy efficiency and energy supply, among others. The bank also provides temporary liquidity for working operational and capital financing, for example for emergency reconstruction following a natural disaster, war, or civil disorder, or temporary liquidity to credit constrained local administrations in a sudden or prolonged economic shocks. 7. Banking sector loans to local government and administrations are limited in amount, especially from commercial banking and participation (non-interest) banking institutions. This is due to the inability/unwillingness to offer lending products tailored to municipal needs, lack of urban sector knowledge and low expected returns. Bank loans in Türkiye are short maturity, concentrating at 1-3 years, while long-term loans as required for municipal infrastructure investments represent a low percentage in total loans, accounting for 13 a percent share as reflected in Chart 1 below. Furthermore, Table 1 below presents a breakdown of municipal loans from the different banking segment groups over the last five years. Despite their limited size within the banking sector, investment and development banks, the group to which ILBANK belongs, has represented a consistently high share in municipal loans. Commercial banks on the other hand are catching up in their lending to the municipal sector albeit coming from a low base, with their exposure picking up only from 2020. Ultimately, total banking sector loans to municipal borrowers are very low, making up for a share at little over 1 percent, thus reflecting a lack of bank financing available and the existing gap to be filled.

Over the past three years commercial banks are fast increasing their penetration into municipal lending thus reflecting their efforts to play a greater role in this market segment. Municipal loans only account for 1.4 percent of all banking loans. The share of commercial banks within municipal loans that the banking sector lends rose to 63 percent in 2022 from 36 percent in 2019, although this share includes short-term loans such as revolving facilities and vehicle/equipment loans up to three years maturity. In long-term general and infrastructure finance loans, ILBANK maintains its dominant role. Apart from market specific constraints, macro financial difficulties currently limit opportunities to crowd-in private investments or develop new and market-based products for municipal finance. Page 79 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) 9. ILBANK, with its unique status providing it with the authorization to intercept up to 40 percent of the general budget revenue transfers, is in a privileged position to intermediate funds from other financial institutions and channel them into municipalities within an extended amortization schedule. This special status has been further reinforced by MOTF`s preference, since the 2000s, to provide a sovereign repayment guarantee to ILBANK rather than the provision of that guarantee directly to municipalities. ILBANK extends loans to support budget spending of the borrower municipality (general obligation), and more sophisticated instruments like ring-fenced project financing are yet to be tested. ILBANK uses an overly simplified formula in assessing borrowing capacity by comparing 40 percent of the annual allotment with the current debt service. This is part of wider evaluation on borrower eligibility although falling short of a standard creditworthiness assessment. 10. Using a combination of credit information, key financial/legal data and analytic tools at its disposal, ILBANK adopts a practical approach incorporating check and assessment of factors. These include: - Current credit exposure and past loan payment performance of the borrower with ILBANK; - Outstanding loan exposure and payment performance of the borrower with other lenders; - Any overdue liabilities to National Treasury (from past borrowings under sovereign guarantee) or to any other public entities arising from due social security payments, unpaid energy bills etc. 11. In the case of IFI sourced financing, the International Relations Department acts as a project management unit (PMU) and responds to analytics driven requests of its lenders as part of its foreign currency lending activities. The technical, economical, environmental and financial aspects of the investment proposal are assessed by the Investment Appraisal Department then submitted as a proposal for approval. The World Bank, under its Sustainable Cities Program, has been working to support ILBANK in creditworthiness assessment of sub-borrower Municipalities/Utilities through expert preparation of reports as part of technical assistance for institutional strengthening. This does not constitute a substitute for ILBANK’s other existing processes or tools but complements those. 12. With its current shareholder structure, mandate, and privileged legislative status, ILBANK emerged as a unique and best-fit institution to channel external financing into municipalities under a sovereign guarantee-backed and secured repayment mechanism. Starting from 2005, through the Municipal Services Project, funded by IBRD, ILBANK initiated its cooperation with IFIs, which has later become a very significant business line for ILBANK (see para. 17 and Table 2 below) 13. As a development bank, ILBANK is held exempt from loan limit prudential ratios, restrictions on ownership shares, commercial property transaction provisions, and provisions on deposits and participation funds. As ILBANK was transformed into an investment and development bank in 2011, it fell under the regulations and supervision of the Central Bank of Türkiye and the Banking Regulatory and Supervision Agency (BRSA). At the same time, ILBANK also came under the supervision of the Financial Crimes Investigation Board of the MoTF (MASAK). Because of its specific status as a state agent and mission of a dedicated municipal lender as stated in its law of incorporation, BRSA made ILBANK exempt from detailed reporting and prudential requirements, including general loan-loss provisioning under IFRS9 and also exempt from the application of specific Basel risk models. ILBANK is not exempt from the Turkish Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations but is subject to Simplified Due Diligence procedures. The bank complies with the Turkish AML regulations. Page 80 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) 14. ILBANK has a strong balance sheet and profitable operations80. The bank’s liabilities are represented by allocated funds from the central budget and long-term loans from IFIs. In 2022 Q3, the share of FX loans was equivalent to 27 percent of total liabilities (Table 2). The MoTF provides payment guarantees for these loans. Although ILBANK has no profit-maximization objective, it has consistently achieved net profits. The bank has a positive return on average equity (9.9 percent) and relatively high returns on average assets (3.6 percent), reflecting its equity-funded model. 15. The bank extends loans only after its funding is secured through its capital or IFI loans, and it is exposed to limited liquidity, interest rate, and currency risk. ILBANK does not carry interest or FX risk on its own balance sheet. ILBANK adds a margin of 1 percent to IFI loans and mirrors the maturities and currencies of its own borrowings, mitigating the liquidity, interest rate, and currency risks it faces. The on-lending rates for IFI foreign currency loans reflect the cost of funds with a small markup and pass the foreign exchange risk to the borrowers’ shoulders. Passing the foreign-currency risks to the borrowers exposes municipalities to FX risk, which can ultimately translate into credit risk for ILBANK. However, given credit risk mitigation measures through the revenue intercept mechanism and the practice of rolling over problem loans, credit risk for ILBANK materializes with delays in practice creating pressure on liquidity, which is manageable currently within the scale of balance sheet. 16. FX risk borne by sub-borrowers is ultimately mitigated by central government guarantee of IFI loans as hedging option is not available. Although MOTF guarantee under IFI lending projects is for İlbank, sub- borrower municipalities’ liabilities to main lender IFI (through intermediary İlbank) are indirectly guaranteed. Although this may create a moral hazard for sub-borrowers they ultimately need to preserve their good standing with Ilbank and MOTF to maintain access to IFI finance. To encourage own management of FX risk by sub-borrowers use of hedging instruments has been evaluated by IFI lenders in conjunction with central government however this has not come to fruition due transactional obstacles including costs and administrative difficulties. 17. ILBANK has total assets of TL 85.8 billion, with loans accounting for TL 40.2 billion, as of Q32022. The sectoral loan allocation breakdown for that amount as of Q32022 is unavailable. According to the most recent publicly available figure in 2015, approximately 94% of planned equity investments were directed toward water and sewage projects, with the remainder allocated for solid waste, housing, and urban projects. ILBANK is also the primary conduit for donor financing and international financial institutions supporting municipal projects. 18. The use of external funds (IFI on-lending) stands at 27 percent of the loan portfolio at the end of end- Q32022. This points to a significant rise over the last two years (FYE2021: 24 percent, FYE2020: 14 percent) in the share of the foreign currency loans mainly due to the depreciation of the local currency and also increase in IFI sourced loans in this period to a lesser degree. ILBANK does not grant pro forma subsidized loans since its lending rates include margins sufficient to cover the cost of operation and losses and even generate intentionally moderate profit; accordingly, it charges a flat (currently 1 percent) administration fee for its loans. However, a more sophisticated risk-based pricing of the products would 80ILBANK has not been rated by international credit agencies since 2015. The full-year FYE2021 audited financial statements of ILBANK have received an unqualified independent audit opinion from KPMG Türkiye on March 9, 2022 and have been approved by the General Assembly on March 24. The interim financial results as of September 2022 have been audited with limited review, by the same auditor. Financial statements obtained unqualified external audits in the last three years on the basis of completeness and accuracy as well as compliance with the provisions of Banking Act Law 5411 and its related decrees on bank supervision. Page 81 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) be justified as ILBANK’s portfolio is expanding with lending at longer maturities, creating higher risk exposure. 19. ILBANK’s key strength is its solid capitalization. According to the latest Türkiye Bankers Association ranking data as of September 2022, including commercial, development, and investment banks, ILBANK was the fifteenth largest Turkish bank in terms of assets and by loan size, the tenth largest by equity size, and the second largest in the sector by paid-in capital size. The bank has a unique capital funding model and status underpinned by: a) amounts to be deducted monthly at a rate of 2 percent of the tax revenues to be distributed by the MoTF and the Bank every month; b) a margin at a rate of 30 percent of the Bank\\'s annual net profit after deducting taxes and other legal liabilities; c) funds deemed appropriate to be transferred to the Bank\\'s capital under other legislation provisions and all kinds of aids and donations to be added to the capital. 20. In line with regulatory exemption and internal procedures, ILBANK does not implement loan classification standards in its credit management but rather uses a revenue interception mechanism or reschedules due loan payments. Therefore ILBANK does not classify its overdue loan receivables as non- performing and rolls over these by including unpaid interest receivables into loan principal amount. As a means of securing loan performance through recovery, ILBANK has been using various mitigation instruments to reduce credit risk, including fiscal transfer interception, escrow accounts, and rolling over non-performing loans (whose data for the last four financial years are provided below in Table 2). 21. Lack of formal and standardized (i.e. internal rules) for estimating expected loan losses and provisioning prevents adoption of a purely risk based pricing. ILBANK’s product offerings and pricing are mainly defined by its mission driven status and cooperatively owned capital structure. Exploration of market driven pricing approaches by ILBANK would enhance financial sustainability as well as resource allocation efficiency also helping to deepen municipal lending by commercial banks. 22. The revenue intercept mechanism is a powerful tool for repaying debt obligations and other public sector entities’ debts. ILBANK and the MoTF are entitled to intercept the apportionments from general budget tax revenues at source and pay the requested amounts to the relevant public authority. The public institutions that can request deductions for their receivables include the MoTF, social security institutions, and ILBANK. ILBANK can also intercept apportionments from general budget revenues regarding payment obligations owed to other local government entities stemming from unpaid water, sewage, and natural gas bills. 23. Despite its strong track record with implementing IBRD and other IFI lending projects, as a financial intermediary for subnational lending and the state’s municipal finance vehicle in Türkiye, the ba nk is under significant pressure to deploy a rapidly expanding international IFI portfolio. ILBANK’s borrowing portfolio from IFIs includes a diversified mix of international development finance institutions with a diverse range of sector reach and geographical focus. ILBANK currently has several lending engagements outside of IBRD comprising Agence Française de Development (AFD), Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), European Investment Bank (EIB) and Islamic Development Bank (IDB). These operations enabled ILBANK to gain experience with environmental and social safeguards, procurement, and financial management policies—all of which support the efficient implementation of lending projects. Once a Page 82 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) relationship modality is set up with an IFI, ILBANK intermediation provides efficiencies in using established processes and mechanisms. 24. Ilbank is subject to BRSA’s regulation that set down the structures and processes relating to the corporate governance of banks and the principles thereof. Accordingly, the bank has established management structures for board of directors enabling an independent and expert evaluation of activities and for senior management to have adequate qualifications to fulfill their duties efficiently. Current members of executive body come from the technical and financial administration backgrounds commensurate with their duties representing main stakeholders including MOEUCC, municipalities and special provincial administrations. Internal control system is in place encompassing risk management, internal control and internal audit function. This system is complemented by board member appointed audit committee working to ensure that control and audit findings are evaluated on a timely basis and necessary corrective actions are taken by the senior management. 25. Based on this FIF assessment, intermediate indicators may be identified to measure both the portfolio quality and profitability of Ilbank. These are derived form the key assessment criteria checklist as prescribed by the applicable FIF Guidance Note Table 2: Summary balance sheet and income statement for ILBANK BALANCE SHEET (TL million) 3Q2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Cash and Banks 37,385 23,505 14,380 5,706 2,838 Securities 2 1 0 0 2 Loans 40,165 33,951 29,591 28,418 28,295 Real Estate Investments 3,684 2,936 2,131 1,575 673 Other 3,775 2,544 777 389 413 Total Assets 85,011 62,936 46,879 36,088 32,221 Borrowings 18,483 13,398 8,100 3,923 3,750 Allocated Funds 30,983 19,173 13,546 10,236 8,242 Other 2,391 1,984 1,101 974 1,649 Equity 33,154 28,381 24,132 20,955 18,580 Total Liabilities 85,011 62,936 46,879 36,088 32,221 INCOME STATEMENT 3Q2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 (TL million) Net Interest Income 3,866 4,360 3,276 2,916 1,998 Net Fees & Commissions 26 13 33 35 16 Dividend Income 0 0 0 0 0 Net Trading Income -5 -38 0 0 -1 Other Operating Income 1,007 506 289 224 750 Total Operating Income 4,894 4,841 3,598 3,175 2,763 (Other Operating -1,628 -1,278 -939 -892 -657 Expenses) Page 83 of 85 The World Bank Türkiye Water Circularity and Efficiency Improvement Project (P174915) Net Operating Income 3,266 3,563 2,659 2,283 2,106 (Tax Provisions) -796 -907 -586 -501 -444 Net Profit 2,470 2,656 2,073 1,782 1,662 Table 3: Key financial ratios (%) 3Q2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Equity/ assets 39.0 40.6 45.5 45.9 45.1 ROE 9.9 12.6 11.0 10.9 11.3 Rollover ratio81 1.5 2.4 3.7 5.2 6.2 Cost to Income 33.3 26.4 26.1 28.1 23.8 81 Capitalizing the overdue interests and rolling over the past due loan receivables has become a standard instrument for ILBANK in managing problem loans as opposed to classifying them as non-performing. This is not a best practice instrument as it creates an opaque situation in measuring the loan performance, since rolled over loans appear as new lending. On the implementation side, roll-over is an internally well-controlled procedure; it requires detailed analysis, negotiation with debtors, and Board approval.

       "\"II. PROJECT DESCRIPTION A. Project Development Objective PDO Statement 29. The objectives of the project are to increase the amount and reliability of fiscal transfers to selected municipalities; strengthen their public financial and land management capacity; and increase identity coverage. PDO Level Indicators 30. Achievement of the PDO above will be measured with the following indicators: i. Municipalities demonstrate strengthened capacity for managing Municipal Performance Grants (number) ii. Public financial management practices strengthened in municipalities (number) iii. Procurement practices enhanced in municipalities (number) iv. Identity coverage of the population (percentage); and at least 50 percent of new ID cards each year are issued to women. B. Project Components 31. The project has five components. These components will be delivered through a combination of technical assistance (TA) and Performance-Based Conditions (PBCs). TA will be provided for capacity-building to strengthen the core functions of municipalities, including PFM, procurement, urban planning, and civil registry services. It will also finance investments in systems and infrastructure services to support improved administrative effectiveness and better services in the areas above. PBCs will support a municipal performance grant (MPG), which will be transferred to select municipalities for needed investments. This will further strengthen the PFM capacity of 24 While outside the scope of this project, targeted support in these areas will be sought through a parallel Bank operation. 25 World Bank.

Page 16 of 59 The World Bank Angola Strengthening Governance for Enhanced Service Delivery Project (P178040) municipal administrations through the practical application of skills relating to all phases of the budget cycle: preparation, authorization, execution, and accountability. This will also help to prepare these municipalities for future decentralization—which will involve greater budgetary autonomy of local governments. The three main components are supported by a project management component. The project also has a Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC). 32. The project will utilize US$125 million of Technical Assistance activities and US$125 million for PBCs. The use of TA and PBC provides the combination of technical support and actual funds for municipalities needed to enable transformational reform. In addition, the project has been designed to ensure that activities are effectively sequenced, with activities in earlier years, including TA, providing a foundation for PBCs and other TA activities in later years. Table 2 summarizes project costs disaggregated by TA and PBC financing for each project component. Component 1: Strengthened Financial Autonomy of Selected Municipalities through Establishment of a Municipal Performance Grant (US$125 million) 33. This component will support the establishment of an MPG fund to incentivize selected municipalities to improve their PFM capacity, thus supporting an enabling environment for better delivery of administrative and public services. Under this component, selected municipalities will receive an annual transfer (MPG) during the life of the project if they comply with certain PFM good practices. This component complements the capacity building activities under Component 2. As such, it will give municipalities the opportunity to apply PFM skills in practice. It will also allow the government to test the newly established PFM legal framework for local governments ahead of the fiscal decentralization process. Municipalities will determine how best to use these resources; while excluding salaries, activities could include operations and maintenance costs of existing infrastructure (schools, clinics, roads); repairs, rehabilitation, and minor works; investments in IT needs (computers and other hardware needs); and other eligible expenditures per World Bank Investment Project Financing (IPF) guidelines.26 Municipalities will be responsible for planning and executing these expenditures, as well as being accountable for them.27 This component will also operationalize the legal requirement for municipalities to consult with citizens across the budget cycle. This will be done via CACs. The government intends to apply the lessons of this experience when rolling out its intergovernmental transfer system, the FEAL, and FEM. Annex 3 provides more details on the MPG, including eligibility, selection criteria, and eligible expenditures. Municipal Grant Procedures will further detail grant modalities (including amounts per municipality) and will be revised during project implementation if and when necessary. More details and PBC annual targets are set out in Annex 2. Component 2: Strengthening Financial and Land Management Capacity in Selected Municipalities (US$85 million) 34. The objective of this component is to strengthen capacity in PFM and urban land management systems. Parallel interventions at the national and municipal levels will help to establish or strengthen fundamental building blocks for robust PFM, efficient municipal administration, and sound urban planning and land management in beneficiary municipalities. This component has two sub-components: 2A will focus on PFM and 2B will focus on urban planning and land management. 26 Directives and Policy for IPF and the World Bank Guidance on Financial Management in World Bank IPF Operations issued on February 28, 2017. 27 Procurement managed by elected municipal governments benefitting from performance grants will be done using the national procurement law (Law nº 6/16 of 16 June 2016), provided that the procurement team receive training from SNCP. Page 17 of 59 The World Bank Angola Strengthening Governance for Enhanced Service Delivery Project (P178040) Subcomponent 2A: Strengthening Central and Subnational PFM Capacity (US$50 million) 35. The subcomponent will support provincial administrations, MAT, and MINFIN (including SNCP). It will finance: (i) training in public financial management, including on: planning and budgeting, public investment and asset management, financial management, public procurement, debt management, internal control, external audit, and revenue management; (ii) training of trainers; and (iii) investments in information systems, platforms, and hardware to enhance the municipal PFM enabling environment. This includes the adoption and use of SIGFE for the preparation and execution of municipal budgets, SNCPE to digitize municipal procurement, and the Citizens’ Portal to facilitate the collection of municipal fees. This support will be provided through various means, with the support of the National School of Administration and Public Policy (Escola de Administração e Políticas Públicas, ENAPP), which is under the Ministry of Public Administration, Labor, and Social Security (MAPTSS), and includes within its mandate the training of civil servants through the facilitation of peer-to-peer learning. 36. The subcomponent will also support selected municipal administrations, CACs, and ENAPP in training development and provision, as well as in upgrading ENAPP’s systems and infrastructure. Alliances with universities and training centers may also be sought to ensure sustainable capacity development. The subcomponent will finance (i) the development and delivery of training for municipal administrations and CACs in, inter alia, planning and budgeting, financial management, public procurement, urban planning, land management and other relevant skills; (ii) training of trainers in these areas; (iii) training of recent graduates in financial management and procurement; and (iv) investment in ENAPP’s systems and infrastructure to expand delivery of training services at scale across municipalities. Support will also be provided to ENAPP to strengthen its ability to deliver training to subnational entities. ENAPP will play a significant role in the provision of training at the municipal level, in coordination with MAT, MINFIN, INOTU/MINOPUH and other relevant counterparts. In addition, CACs will receive support to reinforce their capacity to participate in local planning and budgeting, review of budget execution reports, and preparation of urban planning and land management instruments, building on existing pilot initiatives. Subcomponent 2B: Improving Urban Planning and Land Management in Selected Municipalities (US$35 million) 37. The objective of this subcomponent is to strengthen the institutional capacity for inclusive and resilient urban planning and land management at the national and municipal level. At the national level, the capacity of MINOPUH and INOTU to provide strategic guidance and technical support to municipalities will be strengthened. At the municipal level, the capacity of selected municipalities to fulfill their new responsibilities in urban planning and land management will be strengthened. At both levels, capacity will be built for incorporating climate and disaster risk considerations into territorial planning. Consideration will also be given to the rights and needs of women, indigenous peoples, and other vulnerable groups in land management. To this end, the sub-component will finance the following activities: (a) updating of regulations, guidelines, tools and procedures for urban planning and land management to ensure coherence with the decentralization framework and to strengthen social and environmental standards (including climate change adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk management, citizen engagement, and gender); (b) capacity development related to the preparation of Municipal Master Plans (PDM) and Urbanization Plans (PUs); (c) implementation of the country’s land management information system (SAGIT) in selected municipalities); (d) implementation of participatory cadasters, mainstreaming climate change and reduction of gender gaps; and (e) elaboration of urban plans and modernization of land management information systems in a subset of municipalities. Component 3: Increasing Identity Coverage to Enable Inclusive Access to Services (US$20 million) 38. The objective of this component is to increase identification coverage. This component will increase CR and identification coverage, with particular attention given to vulnerable populations, including women, people Page 18 of 59 The World Bank Angola Strengthening Governance for Enhanced Service Delivery Project (P178040) with disabilities, the elderly, the poor, and people living in rural areas. Expansion of access to identification for vulnerable populations, including women, will be carried out using a holistic approach that will include reducing barriers, promoting awareness of the importance of the ID card, and creating incentives for identification. Identification cards are issued through an electronic system. Furthermore, the component will strengthen MINJUSDH’s institutional and operational capacity and enhance the legal framework, systems, and procedures to support the expansion of civil registration and identification. To this end, the component will finance the following activities: (a) review the legal framework to ensure its conformity with domestic data protection legislation and alignment with international best practices concerning data protection, cybersecurity, and inclusion,28 (b) updating IT systems, including redesigning of business processes and digitizing part of the paper-based birth certificates; (c) strengthening interoperability of the CR with the ID and other government databases, and use of identification information in government one-stop-shops, such as Balcões Únicos de Atendimento ao Público (One- Stop Shops for Public Services, BUAP), and platforms such as the Citizens’ Portal;29 (d) mass communication campaigns focused on behavior changes to raise awareness of the importance of identification, particularly among women and vulnerable populations. Targeting of women will be done through, inter alia, proactively employing women to be a part of the communications campaigns, and carrying out the campaigns at times and locations that are convenient for women in particular such as schools; (e) renovation and expansion of CR units in health facilities; (f) purchase of equipment to expand mobile registration services in areas not served by BI registration and identification centers; and (g) capacity building at the central, provincial, and municipal levels to ensure effective delivery of identification services. An independent third party will be recruited to carry out the oversight of and reporting on the operation and use of the identification systems being designed and implemented under this component. This entity will be responsible for, inter alia, assessing: (a) MINJUSDH’s institutional and operational capacity, their IT systems, and compliance with data protection and privacy standards and practices; (b) interoperability between civil registration, identification and other government databases and platforms; and (c) issuance, and delivery of identification cards to citizens. Component 4: Project Management (US$20 million) 39. This component will support the implementing institutions to achieve project results and provide just in time funds. This component will support the hiring of key staff as part of the project implementation units: one central Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be housed within MAT, and four regional PIUs will support municipalities in their vicinity. It will also finance PBC verification costs, including training and technical assistance to the Tribunal de Contas to support them in carrying out PBC verification in the final two years of project implementation. Component 5: Contingency Emergency Response Component 40. A no-cost Contingency Emergency Response Component (CERC) is included to facilitate access to rapid financing in the event of a natural disaster, either by a formal declaration of a national or regional emergency or upon a formal request. Following an eligible crisis or emergency, the Borrower may request the World Bank to re-allocate project funds to support emergency response and reconstruction. For CERC to be activated, and financing to be provided, the government will need: (a) to submit a request letter for CERC activation and the evidence required to determine the eligibility of the emergency as defined in the CERC Annex to the Project Operations Manual (POM); (b) an Emergency Action Plan, including the emergency expenditures to be financed; 28 See Principles on Identification for Sustainable Development: https://idprinciples.org/. 29 Tothis effect, the national identification department within MINJUSDH has signed an agreement with Data Protection Agency for the sharing of data. Page 19 of 59 The World Bank Angola Strengthening Governance for Enhanced Service Delivery Project (P178040) and (c) to meet the environmental and social requirements as agreed in the Environmental and Social Commitment Plan (ESCP) and CERC Annex. 41. In terms of alignment with the GCRF at the component/subcomponent level, this project supports Pillars 3 and 4. Component 1, subcomponent 2A, and Component 3 of the project are aligned with GCRF Pillar 4, Strengthening Policies, Institutions and Investments for Rebuilding Better. Component 2B is aligned with GCRF Pillar 3, Strengthening Resilience. Table 2: Project Costing by Component (US$ million) Project Components TA PBC Total Component 1.

Results Chain 42. The overall intervention logic of the project is that a combination of increased autonomy and accountability for municipal financing, coupled with technical assistance, will support an enabling environment for decentralization and improved service delivery. The components are designed to prepare selected local administrations in Angola for the implementation of decentralization through the strengthening of institutional structures and systems; capacity building; the reform of regulatory and policy frameworks; and simplifying, standardizing, and modernizing processes for improved service delivery at the municipal level. The Theory of Change is set out in Figure 1. Page 20 of 59 The World Bank Angola Strengthening Governance for Enhanced Service Delivery Project (P178040) Figure 1.

Project Beneficiaries 43. The direct beneficiaries of the project are the institutions and civil servants in the implementing ministries and agencies and within municipal administrations and governments. These include MAT, MINFIN, MINOPUH, and MINJUSDH. The proposed project includes several capacity building activities designed to increase the capacity of Angola’s civil servants to administer and deliver services, thereby improving the overall public sector efficiency. In addition to supporting reforms at the central level, the project will support capacity development of municipal administrations, including through a performance grant. Municipalities were selected through a consultative and validated process which involved relevant national stakeholders. The list of municipalities is presented in Annex 3. 44. Ultimately, all citizens benefit from improved public administration and service delivery, beginning with the targeted municipalities that represent roughly 70 percent of the population and 61 percent of the country’s poor.30 They will benefit directly from: (i) the improved capacity of municipalities to deliver public services; (ii) the 30 While just 16 of the selected municipalities fall in the top two quintiles in terms of the municipal poverty rate, fully 47 of the 58 fall within the top two quintiles in terms of the number of poor people. Page 21 of 59 The World Bank Angola Strengthening Governance for Enhanced Service Delivery Project (P178040) simplified and improved access to civil registration and civil identity documents; and (iii) local governments that are open and responsive to citizens. In addition, decentralized and deconcentrated administrative services should be easier to obtain, thus improving the quality of the lives of citizens within those municipalities. Transparency, accountability, and participation interventions introduced and institutionalized through the project will help to ensure that local governments will be open and responsive to citizens, better able to reflect their interests, and respond to their demands. E. Rationale for Bank Involvement and Role of Partners 45. The technical capacity, international knowledge, and global reach of the World Bank bring added value to the design and implementation of this project. The World Bank has supported similar projects in several countries in Africa, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, and Rwanda, and throughout the world, including in Bangladesh, Brazil, Pakistan, Tunisia, and the West Bank and Gaza.31 The World Bank will bring international expertise in supporting fiscal decentralization, as well as the strengthening of identification systems. The World Bank can also provide linkages with projects in other countries, as well as opportunities for south-south exchanges to enable Angola to benefit from and build on ongoing experiences from similar contexts. For instance, such experience could be gained regarding the use of performance grants in Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania. Global knowledge and experience supporting fiscal and political decentralization will be leveraged and complemented with local expertise—particularly from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Children's Fund. This will help to ensure that lessons from decentralization reforms are duly applied as appropriate. The World Bank will also draw on lessons learned in integrating digital systems into capacity support systems that have the potential to improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of service delivery and strengthen the bottom-up and demand-driven approach to accessing key services at scale. These will provide clear incentives for local entities to focus on strengthening municipal finance and administration. Finally, the international expertise of the World Bank’s Identification for Development initiative, as well as its experience in supporting CR and ID projects, makes the World Bank well-placed to be involved in this project. 46. The World Bank is well positioned to support the GoA in implementing the decentralization reforms that include citizen participation to enhance impact. The World Bank has been a key partner of the GoA in local development and decentralization, including providing TA on the formulation of 2019 legislation, which institutionalizes key aspects of decentralization and the future responsibilities of elected municipal governments. Thus, the World Bank is well positioned to support the government in continuing the implementation of the decentralization agenda, and in incorporating and institutionalizing participatory, inclusive elements into local government systems. This would be achieved by encouraging the more effective use of local government funds for pro-poor investments and services. By strengthening institutional capacity, resource management, and the accountability of local governments, the project will support more effective municipal-level service delivery. Additionally, the project will generate positive externalities for the public sector, including: a) More effective planning and budget preparation to improve the effectiveness of resource management (through PFM-related technical assistance and performance grants). 31 Democratic Republic of Congo: “Enhancing Collection of Revenue and Expenditure Management” (P171762); Kenya: “Program to Strengthen Governance for Enabling Service Delivery and Public Investment in Kenya” (P161387); Mali: “Deployment of State Res ources for Better Service Delivery and COVID-19 Response” (P164561); Rwanda: “Public Sector Governance Program-for-Results” (P149095); Bangladesh: “Local Governance Support Project II” (P124514); Brazil: “SWAp for Parana Multi-sector Development Project” (P126343); Pakistan: “PFM and Accountability to Support Service Delivery PforR” (P157507); Tunisia: “Urban Development and Local Governance” (P130637); and West Bank and Gaza: “Third Municipal Development Project (P159258). Page 22 of 59 The World Bank Angola Strengthening Governance for Enhanced Service Delivery Project (P178040) b) Improved efficiency in subnational public sector spending (through enhanced citizen engagement and the establishment of external audit oversight of municipal finances). c) Increased formality, allowing for private sector development and increased revenue collection. F. Lessons Learned and Reflected in Project Design 47. The project’s design builds on lessons learned from previous World Bank-funded operations in Angola, the region, and globally. As such, it is designed to seek synergies with other World Bank and donor-funded programs. The project adopts a problem-driven approach by addressing the binding constraints that affect the central government’s capacity to effectively implement its decentralization policy, as well as the capacity and incentives of municipal administrations to efficiently manage resources and provide better services to their citizens. These lessons include the following: • Institutionalize municipal PFM instruments. The project will build on the positive experience of the Social Action Fund32 (FAS) in introducing key PFM instruments within municipal administrations, such as strategic planning and budgeting tools, as well as the need to codify these mechanisms into law. The proposed project draws on the experience of the FAS and the Angola Local Development Project33 in aiming to strengthen local accountability by providing resources directly to local governments. Funding will be used at their discretion to meet local development priorities, as well as to strengthen citizen engagement in local governance. • Incentivize a “race to the top” through the MPG. The proposed MPG draws from positive World Bank experiences elsewhere in the region (e.g., in Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique, and Tanzania). Providing results- based financing contingent upon a predetermined series of good governance and PFM minimum standards helps to trigger the positive institutional changes necessary to improve service delivery. The project design also draws on the World Bank’s experience in several countries in the Africa, South Asia, and Middle East and North Africa regions concerning the strengthening of local governance and service delivery through a mix of performance incentives and capacity support. There is growing evidence that supply-side, capacity-building initiatives in areas such as financial management and training are considerably more effective when they are linked with a system that creates demand on the part of targeted local governments. Such a “learning by doing” approach, combined with appropriate incentives for improving institutional performance and targeted capacity support, results in improved accountability and superior service delivery outcomes at the local level. • Rationalize intergovernmental fiscal transfers and increasing their transparency and predictability. The project’s support to assess and redefine transfers based on expenditure needs, as well as support to increase the transparency of distribution formulae and stability of annual transfers is informed by ongoing World Bank support to ensure that intergovernmental fiscal transfers are equitable and predictable. 32 The Fundo de Apoio Social (FAS) was established in 1994 to complement the government’s efforts in the reconstruction of Angola’s physical infrastructure, with the objective of improving access to basic services through the provision or rehabilitation of community infrastructure. The FAS II (2000-2003) continued support for the rehabilitation of social infrastructure, while emphasizing participatory methods of service delivery. The FAS III (2004-2009) incorporated a Municipal Development Component with pilots implemented in 12 localities distributed in 9 provinces. The FAS project successfully demonstrated that community participation in the planning of investment priorities, as well as predictable financing of such priorities can strengthen accountability between citizens and the State. 33 The Local Development Project (LDP) expanded the operational scope of the FAS by extending basic services into Angola’s most remote or underserved municipalities to attain a more equitable spatial coverage of basic service provision in localities where the FAS presence had been negligible. It aimed to enhance the institutional capacity of Angola’s municipalities. Although t he LDP and FAS operations have contributed significantly to the decentralization and deconcentration process in Angola, they have not yet supported municipalities in executing and monitoring their own plans. Page 23 of 59 The World Bank Angola Strengthening Governance for Enhanced Service Delivery Project (P178040) • Leverage social accountability to boost service delivery. The project’s support around institutionalizing citizen participation, monitoring, and oversight in local governance and service delivery is based on lessons learned from similar interventions (e.g., Kenya, Nigeria, and Zambia) designed to establish downward accountability measures, channel citizen-generated data on service delivery bottlenecks in real time to local service delivery units and rebuild the social contract. • Complement existing initiatives from other partners. The project complements and coordinates with related programs financed by cooperating development partners. The project is complementary to the United Nations Children's Fund public finance subprogram in Angola that supports analysis and monitoring of national investments in the social sectors. It also complements the UNDP’s technical assistance and policy advice provided to the GoA concerning decentralization, as well as capacity building for local governance and citizen participation. Thus, the project strives to build synergies and avoid duplication with these programs. • Additional lessons taken into account when designing this project include: (i) adopting a gradual, systemic approach to implementation; (ii) strengthening territorial planning and land management at the municipal level; (iii) promoting a cross-cutting approach to fighting corruption through efforts to improve transparency and accountability in the management of public finances; (iv) establishing a digital civil registration system that is universally accessible and contains basic/minimal biographic data for authentication and verification in collaboration with other systems; and (v) recognizing the need for a robust legal and regulatory framework underpinning civil registration, as well as the harmonization of existing systems, as critical enablers for success.\""

       "\"B. Project Components 32. The proposed project will support: (i) the GOT’s measures to mitigate the COVID-19 impact on poor and low-income households as well as (ii) the AMEN Social program. It was prepared with a view to leverage different sources of funding that are uniquely suited to address specific challenges and support social protection programs. As a result, the proposed activities will be supported by a US$300 million IBRD loan and a US$18 million equivalent grant from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF)22. The proposed project includes four components. The first component supports the government’s response to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and will include financing, in part retroactively, of the AMEN Social PCT and its targeted expansion to support poor households enrolled in the program, and the financing of TCT to support poor and vulnerable households. The second component will support the Family Allowance component of the AMEN Social program with a focus on mitigating the impact of the pandemic on families with children, while protecting their human capital. The third component will support the strengthening of the social protection system to deliver efficient and inclusive programs. The project also includes a Response 22Funds are expected to be available within the first year of implementation. This support can be implemented through Bank administrated Trust Funds, which will used to finance Family Allowance under component 2 and activities under component 3, for which implementation is scheduled at the beginning of year two of the project. In the unlikely event that the funds do not materialize, the project would be restructured. Page 18 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) Component (CERC) with zero funds allocated for the time being, which would allow the government to request a rapid reallocation of project funds to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible emergency or crisis. 33. The proposed response and recovery strategy will provide the required coverage of the poor and vulnerable population. As illustrated in Figure 1, the GOT has at its disposal the infrastructure to provide social assistance (under the AMEN Social program.). The objective of the government’s response, in the short term, will be to implement the Temporary Cash Transfer by making use of this infrastructure and mitigate the impact of the crises by providing additional transfers to those receiving PCT, a limited number of transfers to those having a subsidized health card, and those currently not included in the AMEN Social database, and not covered by the formal social protection program (National Social Security Fund - CNSS). The expansion of the number of poor covered by the PCT in the medium term, starting in 2021, will address the increase in poverty as a result of the pandemic and facilitate the recovery of the poor. The expansion of the Family Allowance will further expand the coverage to all children the age of 0-5 and provide a needed boost to the human capital accumulation of the children. Figure 1: Current and Expected Coverage of Social Assistance Beneficiaries Component 1. Cash Transfers to Mitigate the Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis (US$245 million, of which US$25 million in Performance-Based Conditions (PBCs)) 34. Component 1 will finance cash transfers to poor and vulnerable households enrolled in the AMEN Social program and those eligible for temporary programs. The project will provide support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic through: (i) the provision of TCT to beneficiaries under the AMEN Social Program; (ii) the provision of PCT to beneficiaries under the AMEN Social Program; and (iii) Page 19 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) the expansion of the provision of PCT to additional poor households under the AMEN Social Program through the strengthening of the AMEN Social Program targeting system. 35. The first sub-component will support the GOT’s emergency measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 crisis on poor and vulnerable households by financing (temporary cash transfers of US$100 million. MOSA will use the AMEN Social program as a framework to implement TCT through a vertical and horizontal expansion of existing cash transfer services. The second sub-component will provide direct financing, retroactively, of PCT under the AMEN Social program to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on poor households and ensure its continuity (US$120 million). The third subcomponent will focus on improving the coverage of poor households through expanding the PCT using the new delivery system of the AMEN Social program, including the targeting model (US$25 million). The proposed activities will be grounded in the current AMEN Social program structure and coverage, as well as the experience of emergency cash transfers during the last year. Subcomponent 1.1: TCT to Poor and Vulnerable Households (US$100 million) 36. Financing of TCT will cover approximately one million poor and vulnerable households. Building on the lessons learned from the Emergency Cash Transfers delivered in 2020 to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, the GOT will provide TCTs to poor and vulnerable households using the AMEN Social registry. Currently, the database includes: (i) about 260,000 poor households (8 percent of the population) receiving PCT; and (ii) 450,000 vulnerable households enrolled in the AMEN Social registry that are receiving the subsidized health card, but are not benefiting from the PCT. In addition, in May 2020 the MOSA enrolled (through a simplified form) more than 300,000 additional households that were not covered by any social protection program who applied to the COVID-19 Emergency Cash Transfers.23 The reuse of this approach will considerably reduce the exclusion risk. 37. Beneficiary selection and enrollment. All households enrolled in the AMEN Social database will be considered eligible to TCT after their status is verified using administrative information through the inter-operability platform. This platform allows MOSA to update the information on households using administrative databases. It provides information on beneficiary working status in the formal sector and their wages as well as other sources of formal income (e.g., pensions) and assets (e.g., vehicles), obtained automatically from other public institutions. MOSA also has a Social MIS with a digital enrollment module that is deployed in more than 260 local social promotion units throughout the country. More than 1,300 social workers24 are trained to use the system to ensure the swift enrollment of households in an integrated registry. In addition, MOSA will carry out an outreach campaign and allow the enrollment of additional households for the TCT program. Building on the experience of the Emergency Cash Transfer deployed in April – May 2020 to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and the recommendations of the ex- 23 Some of these households are enrolled in the AMEN Social program, albeit without complete information. Others are new applicants. 24 Civil Servants with a university education level in the social field assigned to social development local units under MOSA. About 80 percent are women and ensure close contact with populations at the local level. Page 20 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) post evaluation, MOSA will improve the existing AMEN Social MIS to overcome some implementation challenges25 by upgrading the data management and inter-operability platform. 38. Level of benefit. The TCT amount will vary according to the household category. Poor households already receiving PCT will benefit from two payments of temporary TND 90 (US$33) top-up cash transfers during April - May 2021. The transfer amounts for vulnerable households benefiting only from the subsidized health insurance card of the AMEN Social program will be about TND 300 (about US$110). This is equivalent to the monthly transfer that poor households receive and will help to mitigate the impact of the crisis on household’s welfare. 39. Payment system. Beneficiaries of the PCT will be paid through their AMEN payment card. Beneficiaries of the TCT will be paid under the new mobile payment platform), which allows withdrawals of the transfers from ATMs as well as postal and bank offices. 40. Grievance and Redress Mechanism. The MOSA will build on lessons learned from the 2020 Cash Transfers and feedback from the Iterative Beneficiary Monitoring (IBM)26 survey to improve the Grievance Redress system. Grievances will be collected at the local unit, at the MOSA citizen relations office (BRC), through online complaints and grievance forms, and a free phone number. The online form has an automated link to the GRM module in the MIS of the AMEN Social program. The GRM process includes the MIS module supported under the Recipient-Executed grant which supported the Tunisia Social Protection Reforms Support Project (P144674 - closed in 2019). A draft Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) including a GRM was prepared and published on March 15, 2021. Sub-component 1.2: Support to the Existing PCT (US$120 million) 41. This sub-component will retroactively finance the AMEN Social PCT for a total amount of US$120 million, covering approximately 160,000 of the current 260,000 beneficiary households in 2020 and in 2021. Recognizing that the impact of the COVID-19 crisis has continued to affect poor households and that the fiscal stress may not enable the GOT to maintain these payments, this sub-component will retroactively support the monthly PCT as an effective tool to preserve livelihoods. In doing so, it aims to ensure that poor households (especially in rural areas) receive the support they need to maintain their consumption, have access to adequate health care and basic services, and protect their food security and nutritional status. Sub-component 1.3: Targeted Expansion of AMEN Social PCT (US$25 million) 25 Main improvements of the AMEN Social MIS are (i) data cross-checking webservices through the interoperability platform as for assets (vehicles) , systematic check with civil registry (ii) deployment of GRM , scoring and decision modules (iii) development of new module of online intaking and applications follow-up (iv) deployment of the targeting algorithm 26 The IBM survey was carried out by the MOSA with the support of the World Bank to evaluate the implementation process and provide feedback from beneficiaries of COVID-19 ECT. The survey covered important aspect including outreach, enrollment, GRM and access to CT. Page 21 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) 42. This sub-component will finance the expansion of the AMEN Social PCT upon the achievement of PBC#1 (US$25 million). The MOSA will start a targeted expansion of the PCT to cover an additional two percent of the population. This expansion will provide support to an additional 50,000 poor households to strengthen their resilience and support their recovery. This sub-component will finance an expansion of 25,000 new beneficiaries during the second semester of 2021 (US$5 million) and of a total of 50,000 new beneficiaries during 2022 (US$15 million). It will continue to finance a part of the cost of retaining the new beneficiaries in the system and replacing ineligible households during 2023 (US$5 million). 43. Additional households will be included in the PCT component of the AMEN Social program on the basis of the new, more efficient targeting system. The current beneficiaries of PCT have been selected based on a combination of self-declared income, household size, household members unable to work and other criteria. The new selection process (eligibility criteria and inclusion and exclusion filters) and the scoring formula have been described in the Organic Law 2019-10 “AMEN Social” and Government Decree No. 2020-317; it also specifies the process of accessing the AMEN Social program and the grievance mechanism. The targeted expansion of PCT will improve coverage of the poor population, using transparent, objective and equitable criteria (Law 2019-10: Chapter 1, Article 2). As a result, the PCT coverage will increase from 8 to 10 percent of the population, and the targeting efficiency of the program will increase from 17 percent to more than 30 percent. 44. MOSA will initially apply a simplified specification Proxy Means Test (PMT) scoring model that does not require the finalization of the social survey. The performance of this model specification is very similar to the full specification, but the calculation of the score is only based on administrative data available in the AMEN Social registry. It will allow MOSA to have a preliminary list of households that may be eligible for the PCT. This approach will allow the prioritization of the households to be visited by social workers, and overcome the challenges relating to the finalization of the field survey of all registered households, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. The social survey will provide needed information to confirm their eligibility using the complete targeting model. Component 2. Cash Transfers for Human Capital Development (US$42 million) 45. Component 2 will support the design and implementation of the Family Allowance, with accompanying measures for children aged 0 to 5 years from poor and vulnerable households. This component will support the strengthening of the family allowance sub-program under the AMEN Social program through: (i) the provision of Family Allowance for children 0 to 5 years old of poor and vulnerable households under the AMEN Social program; (ii) the carrying out of an assessment of the existing Family Allowance pilot program and preparation and validation of an action plan with recommendations for strengthening the family allowance sub-program, including through the development of accompanying measures aimed at fostering behavioral changes in parenting practices; and (iii) the sustainable expansion of the Family Allowance for all children 0 to 5 years old of poor and vulnerable households under the AMEN Social program. Page 22 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) 46. Component 2 will include two activities: (i) support to Family Allowance transfers following on the ongoing pilot; and (ii) design of soft-conditionalities in the form of participation in accompanying measures that promote behavioral change for the human capital development of children. The proposed activities will capitalize on the policy measures supported by the Bank-financed “Tunisia First Resilience and Recovery Emergency Development Policy Development Financing” (P173324),) and the pilot implemented by MOSA with the support of UNICEF and the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) Development Bank, which aims to expand and strengthen Family Allowances for children 0-5 years old from poor and vulnerable households. Currently, the pilot provides transfers for eight months to about 50,000 children of housholds registred in the AMEN Social program, and includes a set of accompanying measures implemented through social media and social workers. This category of the population is highly vulnerable to shocks, including the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, and was excluded from receiving any assistance before the creation of the AMEN Social program. Cash transfer programs can help to mitigate the detrimental effects that poverty and its associated risks have on child development, supporting human capital accumulation and reducing inequality early in life. In addition, accompanying services should help mitigate the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, by supporting behavioral change to improve access to basic social services and promote good parenting practices. 47. The first activity will provide monetary support in the amount of 30 TND (US$11) per month per child for children from 0-5 years from poor and vulnerable households in Tunisia. Specifically, it will include children of beneficiaries of the AMEN Social program receiving PCT (about 13,000 children) and those having only the subsidized health card (more than 100,000 children). The implementation of this activity during 2022 and 2023 will build on lessons learned and on an evaluation of the ongoing pilot implemented by MOSA. 48. The second activity under this component will finance the AMEN Social program upon the achievement of PBC#2 (US$6 million) to support the validation and publication of the assessment of the Family Allowances pilot for children from poor and vulnerable households, including the accompanying measures. The assessment of the Family Allowance program will cover an evaluation of the impact of the Family Allowance on household’s welfare and a range of indicators on Early Childhood Development outcomes. It will also shed light on the implementation of the program, including aspects linked to the identification and enrollment of families with children from 0-5 years of age, as well as access to the benefit using the different payment systems. In addition, the report will include recommendations and an action plan to improve the design and delivery of accompanying measures, in light of the lessons learned from the pilot supported by UNICEF. 49. Within this activity, the project will also reflect the development of accompanying measures that can help the cash transfer program achieve their core objectives of improving the human capital of children and reducing the intergenerational transmission of poverty. There is significant evidence that cash transfers, combined with accompanying measures27 that foster behavioral changes in parenting 27 Large-scale parenting interventions, though few, have also proved to have positive impacts on children’s development, Page 23 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) practices to promote early childhood nutrition, psychosocial stimulation, or health have larger impacts on childhood development than cash transfer programs alone, and that these results are often more prominent among younger children. Based on the experience of the pilot supported by UNICEF, the project will be able to design and improve accompanying measures that can help parents to change their behaviors and overcome the constraints and barriers to human capital development of children further threatened by the consequences of the recent pandemic. These parenting programs will also stress the value of girls’ education and the involvement of fathers, which can help close the gender gap in ECD outlined above and have a larger involvement of fathers.28 In the Tunisian context, parenting programs can focus on information to raise awareness on prenatal and postnatal care, feeding practices, nutrition, child stimulation, positive discipline, and the value of preschool education. The implementation design will explore a series of platforms, including social marketing, text messages, specific sessions with beneficiaries facilitated in the community by trained social workers, community health care workers, or volunteers, which can be combined with follow up home visits. These types of activities will also build complementarity with existing arrangements and also leverage the Bank-financed project in basic education and in the health sector. 50. In addition, PBC#3 (US$6 million) will incentivize the sustainability of the expansion of the Family Allowance beyond the life of the project. Building on the results of the pilot evaluation and the proposed action plan, this PBC will support the adoption of a permanent expansion of Family Allowance to all 0 to 5-year-old children from households enrolled in the AMEN Social program. Specifically, it will include children of all beneficiaries of the AMEN Social program receiving PCT and those having a subsidized health card. Thus, the AMEN Social program will provide, in addition to health insurance, a cash transfer to all vulnerable households with children between 0 and 5 years. This will expand the coverage of cash transfer programs and promote the human capital of children. Component 3. Strengthening the Social Protection System (US$30.25 million) 51. Component 3 will strengthen the social protection system to deliver efficient and inclusive programs. This component will support: (a) the strengthening of Tunisia’s social protection system to deliver efficient and inclusive social assistance through the AMEN Social Program (i) the update of the scoring formula and the implementation of the full specification PM model of the new targeting system under the AMEN Social Program, (ii) the preparation and publication of annual reports of the AMEN Social Program and (iii) the strengthening of the digitalization of payments under the AMEN Social Program; and (iii) the enhancement of the performance of the social protection system through, inter alia: (a) the preparation of monitoring and evaluation reports and impact assessment(s); (b) the implementation of an outreach communication campaign and the carrying out of beneficiary monitoring survey(s). including cognition and skills, in both the USA[9] and Peru[10]. Positive impacts are not only expected for children but also for women, where evidence shows, for example, that CTs conditional on some behaviors are linked with decreases in domestic violence[11]. 28 Currently the share of parents involved in early childhood education varies greatly by gender of caregivers, with mothers (64.4 percent) and fathers (28.2percent) (REF). Page 24 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) 52. This component will finance the AMEN Social program on the achievement of PBCs #4, 5 and 6; see below. In addition, this component will finance activities that will focus on the improvement of targeting, communication/outreach strategies and GRM. 53. PBC#4 (US$5 million) aims to improve the targeting efficiency of the AMEN Social program by updating of the scoring formula and the use of the full specification of the PMT model. The new targeting tool based on the PMT formula is ready to be deployed for all new beneficiaries of the AMEN Social program.29 Welfare The technical work to design the PMT model was supported and reviewed by the Bank. The results show that the application of the PMT model will significantly improve the level of targeting performance compared to the current model. The analysis of the efficiency of the new scoring formula on real household data and feedback from potential beneficiaries through the GRM system will facilitate the implementation of a more efficient model, requiring both administrative data and information from household visits to assess their welfare. This approach will also allow the establishment of a continuous process of improvement of the targeting system for social programs, based on evidence and lessons learned. 54. PBC#5 (US$10 million) will incentivize the MOSA’s efforts to improve communication, monitoring and evaluation of the AMEN Social program through the preparation and publication of annual reports. The MOSA will prepare and publish a comprehensive report each year on the implementation of the AMEN Social program, including feedback from beneficiaries through IBM surveys and focus groups. In doing so, MOSA will systematically assess some of the main challenges in the AMEN Social program processes, evaluating strengths and weaknesses over the course of two years, and draw key lessons. 55. PBC#6 (US$5 million) will reinforce the digital payment infrastructure under the AMEN Social program. Experience from the first emergency response during 2020 showed that it is crucial to ensure rapid and safe delivery of payments to beneficiaries and avoid sanitary risks due to queuing for payments. In addition, the digital payment infrastructure will incorporate climate resilience design and ensure service continuity during climate events. Activities under this component will support using digital payments (i.e., mobile payments and ATM withdrawals, bank transfers, etc., depending on beneficiaries’ preferences) to reduce time and cost, and ensure a safe transfer for beneficiary households receiving PCT and Family Allowances. These activities will capitalize on the ongoing technical assistance provided by the World Bank to assess the existing digital payment infrastructure and make recommendations for improvement. 56. Component 3 will also finance activities on targeting, GRM, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) studies, and communication, to further strengthen the performance of the social protection system (US$2.25 million). This component will finance studies, M&E reports, operational manuals and IBM phone surveys to assess the efficiency of the programs, receive feedback from beneficiaries and provide 29 This first PMT model was designed by CRES using the ENBCM 2015 from INS. Page 25 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) information on the implementation of the program and foster a continuous improvement of the social protection system. The rigorous monitoring and evaluation of processes will provide information on the performance of the social protection system and identify the effectiveness of the programs. These activities will allow Tunisia to ensure that it serves its poor and vulnerable households and their children in an efficient and cost-effective manner. These activities will also contribute to the development of national capacity for impact evaluation of the social programs. IBM surveys will provide disaggregated data by type of service, household and gender (covering all phases of the delivery system from outreach to payment and GRM processes). 57. The proposed project will finance a communication campaign, including through direct messaging to beneficiaries and eligible households, to ensure participation and program results. Communications will focus on the temporary nature of support for TCTs and the vertical/horizontal expansion of social safety nets for PCT (Components 1 and 2). Internal and external communications are essential to guarantee buy-in from all stakeholders for the reforms to the social protection system and its activities. In addition, outreach is crucial to make the TCT and PCT efficient and inclusive, as described in Component 1. This component will co-finance activities such as workshops, trainings and communication plans and activities. The implementation of these activities will capitalize on lessons learned during the first communication campaigns implemented in (i) 2019 after the validation and the publication of the AMEN Social Law, and (ii) 2020 to support mitigation measures during the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown. Component 4. CERC (US$0) 58. This component would provide immediate response to an eligible crisis or emergency, as needed. This component will allow the GOT to request the World Bank for a rapid allocation of project funds to the CERC to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible emergency or crisis. If the requirements for activation are met, the World Bank will reallocate resources from the disbursement categories of the project to the CERC category to finance eligible expenditures for the emergency response. Expenditures will be evaluated and reviewed to determine if they are acceptable to the World Bank prior to disbursement. Allocation of Funds by Components and Year 59. The proposed project will use direct expenditures and PBCs to incentivize achievement of results PDO, as outlined in Table 2. The operation will use direct expenditures to support the government's urgent response to the COVID-19 crisis during the second quarter of 2021. It will also support the existing PCT of the AMEN Social program to ensure that poor households will continue to receive the support they need during the second half of 2021 and in 2022. Support for the PCT will also cover the government's strategy to expand the coverage of benefit during this economic crisis. In addition, starting 2022, the operation will also finance the expansion of Family Allowances under the AMEN Social program. Finally, the planned technical activities, starting 2022, will strengthen the AMEN Social program and the overall social protection system to ensure the resilience of households. Page 26 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) 60. The PBCs will be linked to the AMEN Social program’s recurrent expenditures. This program is the cornerstone of the support to the poor and vulnerable population and the reform strategy for the improvement of social protection system. The GOT recognizes the importance of this program and will continue to provide it with the budget needed to continue government operation of the program throughout the project period and beyond. The PBCs will incentivize the improvement of efficiency and the delivery of cash transfer benefits under AMEN Social program. The operation will finance the three budget lines of the AMEN Social program upon achievement of the expected results. PBC 1, under Component 1 will support the expansion of the PCT under the AMEN Social program using an improved targeting mechanism. The achievement of PBCs 2-3, under Component 2, will support the expansion and improvement of the Family Allowance benefit under the AMEN Social program. The achievement of PBCs 4, 5 and 6, under Component 3 will support the strengthening of the social protection system. All of the project activities listed in the table below are essential for the establishment of an integrated and functional delivery system to efficiently provide social protection services in climate vulnerable areas.

       "\"B. Project Components 32. The proposed project will support: (i) the GOT’s measures to mitigate the COVID-19 impact on poor and low-income households as well as (ii) the AMEN Social program. It was prepared with a view to leverage different sources of funding that are uniquely suited to address specific challenges and support social protection programs. As a result, the proposed activities will be supported by a US$300 million IBRD loan and a US$18 million equivalent grant from the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF)22. The proposed project includes four components. The first component supports the government’s response to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis and will include financing, in part retroactively, of the AMEN Social PCT and its targeted expansion to support poor households enrolled in the program, and the financing of TCT to support poor and vulnerable households. The second component will support the Family Allowance component of the AMEN Social program with a focus on mitigating the impact of the pandemic on families with children, while protecting their human capital. The third component will support the strengthening of the social protection system to deliver efficient and inclusive programs. The project also includes a Response 22Funds are expected to be available within the first year of implementation. This support can be implemented through Bank administrated Trust Funds, which will used to finance Family Allowance under component 2 and activities under component 3, for which implementation is scheduled at the beginning of year two of the project. In the unlikely event that the funds do not materialize, the project would be restructured. Page 18 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) Component (CERC) with zero funds allocated for the time being, which would allow the government to request a rapid reallocation of project funds to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible emergency or crisis. 33. The proposed response and recovery strategy will provide the required coverage of the poor and vulnerable population. As illustrated in Figure 1, the GOT has at its disposal the infrastructure to provide social assistance (under the AMEN Social program.). The objective of the government’s response, in the short term, will be to implement the Temporary Cash Transfer by making use of this infrastructure and mitigate the impact of the crises by providing additional transfers to those receiving PCT, a limited number of transfers to those having a subsidized health card, and those currently not included in the AMEN Social database, and not covered by the formal social protection program (National Social Security Fund - CNSS). The expansion of the number of poor covered by the PCT in the medium term, starting in 2021, will address the increase in poverty as a result of the pandemic and facilitate the recovery of the poor. The expansion of the Family Allowance will further expand the coverage to all children the age of 0-5 and provide a needed boost to the human capital accumulation of the children. Figure 1: Current and Expected Coverage of Social Assistance Beneficiaries Component 1. Cash Transfers to Mitigate the Impact of the COVID-19 Crisis (US$245 million, of which US$25 million in Performance-Based Conditions (PBCs)) 34. Component 1 will finance cash transfers to poor and vulnerable households enrolled in the AMEN Social program and those eligible for temporary programs. The project will provide support to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic through: (i) the provision of TCT to beneficiaries under the AMEN Social Program; (ii) the provision of PCT to beneficiaries under the AMEN Social Program; and (iii) Page 19 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) the expansion of the provision of PCT to additional poor households under the AMEN Social Program through the strengthening of the AMEN Social Program targeting system. 35. The first sub-component will support the GOT’s emergency measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 crisis on poor and vulnerable households by financing (temporary cash transfers of US$100 million. MOSA will use the AMEN Social program as a framework to implement TCT through a vertical and horizontal expansion of existing cash transfer services. The second sub-component will provide direct financing, retroactively, of PCT under the AMEN Social program to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on poor households and ensure its continuity (US$120 million). The third subcomponent will focus on improving the coverage of poor households through expanding the PCT using the new delivery system of the AMEN Social program, including the targeting model (US$25 million). The proposed activities will be grounded in the current AMEN Social program structure and coverage, as well as the experience of emergency cash transfers during the last year. Subcomponent 1.1: TCT to Poor and Vulnerable Households (US$100 million) 36. Financing of TCT will cover approximately one million poor and vulnerable households. Building on the lessons learned from the Emergency Cash Transfers delivered in 2020 to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, the GOT will provide TCTs to poor and vulnerable households using the AMEN Social registry. Currently, the database includes: (i) about 260,000 poor households (8 percent of the population) receiving PCT; and (ii) 450,000 vulnerable households enrolled in the AMEN Social registry that are receiving the subsidized health card, but are not benefiting from the PCT. In addition, in May 2020 the MOSA enrolled (through a simplified form) more than 300,000 additional households that were not covered by any social protection program who applied to the COVID-19 Emergency Cash Transfers.23 The reuse of this approach will considerably reduce the exclusion risk. 37. Beneficiary selection and enrollment. All households enrolled in the AMEN Social database will be considered eligible to TCT after their status is verified using administrative information through the inter-operability platform. This platform allows MOSA to update the information on households using administrative databases. It provides information on beneficiary working status in the formal sector and their wages as well as other sources of formal income (e.g., pensions) and assets (e.g., vehicles), obtained automatically from other public institutions. MOSA also has a Social MIS with a digital enrollment module that is deployed in more than 260 local social promotion units throughout the country. More than 1,300 social workers24 are trained to use the system to ensure the swift enrollment of households in an integrated registry. In addition, MOSA will carry out an outreach campaign and allow the enrollment of additional households for the TCT program. Building on the experience of the Emergency Cash Transfer deployed in April – May 2020 to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and the recommendations of the ex- 23 Some of these households are enrolled in the AMEN Social program, albeit without complete information. Others are new applicants. 24 Civil Servants with a university education level in the social field assigned to social development local units under MOSA. About 80 percent are women and ensure close contact with populations at the local level. Page 20 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) post evaluation, MOSA will improve the existing AMEN Social MIS to overcome some implementation challenges25 by upgrading the data management and inter-operability platform. 38. Level of benefit. The TCT amount will vary according to the household category. Poor households already receiving PCT will benefit from two payments of temporary TND 90 (US$33) top-up cash transfers during April - May 2021. The transfer amounts for vulnerable households benefiting only from the subsidized health insurance card of the AMEN Social program will be about TND 300 (about US$110). This is equivalent to the monthly transfer that poor households receive and will help to mitigate the impact of the crisis on household’s welfare. 39. Payment system. Beneficiaries of the PCT will be paid through their AMEN payment card. Beneficiaries of the TCT will be paid under the new mobile payment platform), which allows withdrawals of the transfers from ATMs as well as postal and bank offices. 40. Grievance and Redress Mechanism. The MOSA will build on lessons learned from the 2020 Cash Transfers and feedback from the Iterative Beneficiary Monitoring (IBM)26 survey to improve the Grievance Redress system. Grievances will be collected at the local unit, at the MOSA citizen relations office (BRC), through online complaints and grievance forms, and a free phone number. The online form has an automated link to the GRM module in the MIS of the AMEN Social program. The GRM process includes the MIS module supported under the Recipient-Executed grant which supported the Tunisia Social Protection Reforms Support Project (P144674 - closed in 2019). A draft Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) including a GRM was prepared and published on March 15, 2021. Sub-component 1.2: Support to the Existing PCT (US$120 million) 41. This sub-component will retroactively finance the AMEN Social PCT for a total amount of US$120 million, covering approximately 160,000 of the current 260,000 beneficiary households in 2020 and in 2021. Recognizing that the impact of the COVID-19 crisis has continued to affect poor households and that the fiscal stress may not enable the GOT to maintain these payments, this sub-component will retroactively support the monthly PCT as an effective tool to preserve livelihoods. In doing so, it aims to ensure that poor households (especially in rural areas) receive the support they need to maintain their consumption, have access to adequate health care and basic services, and protect their food security and nutritional status. Sub-component 1.3: Targeted Expansion of AMEN Social PCT (US$25 million) 25 Main improvements of the AMEN Social MIS are (i) data cross-checking webservices through the interoperability platform as for assets (vehicles) , systematic check with civil registry (ii) deployment of GRM , scoring and decision modules (iii) development of new module of online intaking and applications follow-up (iv) deployment of the targeting algorithm 26 The IBM survey was carried out by the MOSA with the support of the World Bank to evaluate the implementation process and provide feedback from beneficiaries of COVID-19 ECT. The survey covered important aspect including outreach, enrollment, GRM and access to CT. Page 21 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) 42. This sub-component will finance the expansion of the AMEN Social PCT upon the achievement of PBC#1 (US$25 million). The MOSA will start a targeted expansion of the PCT to cover an additional two percent of the population. This expansion will provide support to an additional 50,000 poor households to strengthen their resilience and support their recovery. This sub-component will finance an expansion of 25,000 new beneficiaries during the second semester of 2021 (US$5 million) and of a total of 50,000 new beneficiaries during 2022 (US$15 million). It will continue to finance a part of the cost of retaining the new beneficiaries in the system and replacing ineligible households during 2023 (US$5 million). 43. Additional households will be included in the PCT component of the AMEN Social program on the basis of the new, more efficient targeting system. The current beneficiaries of PCT have been selected based on a combination of self-declared income, household size, household members unable to work and other criteria. The new selection process (eligibility criteria and inclusion and exclusion filters) and the scoring formula have been described in the Organic Law 2019-10 “AMEN Social” and Government Decree No. 2020-317; it also specifies the process of accessing the AMEN Social program and the grievance mechanism. The targeted expansion of PCT will improve coverage of the poor population, using transparent, objective and equitable criteria (Law 2019-10: Chapter 1, Article 2). As a result, the PCT coverage will increase from 8 to 10 percent of the population, and the targeting efficiency of the program will increase from 17 percent to more than 30 percent. 44. MOSA will initially apply a simplified specification Proxy Means Test (PMT) scoring model that does not require the finalization of the social survey. The performance of this model specification is very similar to the full specification, but the calculation of the score is only based on administrative data available in the AMEN Social registry. It will allow MOSA to have a preliminary list of households that may be eligible for the PCT. This approach will allow the prioritization of the households to be visited by social workers, and overcome the challenges relating to the finalization of the field survey of all registered households, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 crisis. The social survey will provide needed information to confirm their eligibility using the complete targeting model. Component 2. Cash Transfers for Human Capital Development (US$42 million) 45. Component 2 will support the design and implementation of the Family Allowance, with accompanying measures for children aged 0 to 5 years from poor and vulnerable households. This component will support the strengthening of the family allowance sub-program under the AMEN Social program through: (i) the provision of Family Allowance for children 0 to 5 years old of poor and vulnerable households under the AMEN Social program; (ii) the carrying out of an assessment of the existing Family Allowance pilot program and preparation and validation of an action plan with recommendations for strengthening the family allowance sub-program, including through the development of accompanying measures aimed at fostering behavioral changes in parenting practices; and (iii) the sustainable expansion of the Family Allowance for all children 0 to 5 years old of poor and vulnerable households under the AMEN Social program. Page 22 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) 46. Component 2 will include two activities: (i) support to Family Allowance transfers following on the ongoing pilot; and (ii) design of soft-conditionalities in the form of participation in accompanying measures that promote behavioral change for the human capital development of children. The proposed activities will capitalize on the policy measures supported by the Bank-financed “Tunisia First Resilience and Recovery Emergency Development Policy Development Financing” (P173324),) and the pilot implemented by MOSA with the support of UNICEF and the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW) Development Bank, which aims to expand and strengthen Family Allowances for children 0-5 years old from poor and vulnerable households. Currently, the pilot provides transfers for eight months to about 50,000 children of housholds registred in the AMEN Social program, and includes a set of accompanying measures implemented through social media and social workers. This category of the population is highly vulnerable to shocks, including the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, and was excluded from receiving any assistance before the creation of the AMEN Social program. Cash transfer programs can help to mitigate the detrimental effects that poverty and its associated risks have on child development, supporting human capital accumulation and reducing inequality early in life. In addition, accompanying services should help mitigate the socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, by supporting behavioral change to improve access to basic social services and promote good parenting practices. 47. The first activity will provide monetary support in the amount of 30 TND (US$11) per month per child for children from 0-5 years from poor and vulnerable households in Tunisia. Specifically, it will include children of beneficiaries of the AMEN Social program receiving PCT (about 13,000 children) and those having only the subsidized health card (more than 100,000 children). The implementation of this activity during 2022 and 2023 will build on lessons learned and on an evaluation of the ongoing pilot implemented by MOSA. 48. The second activity under this component will finance the AMEN Social program upon the achievement of PBC#2 (US$6 million) to support the validation and publication of the assessment of the Family Allowances pilot for children from poor and vulnerable households, including the accompanying measures. The assessment of the Family Allowance program will cover an evaluation of the impact of the Family Allowance on household’s welfare and a range of indicators on Early Childhood Development outcomes. It will also shed light on the implementation of the program, including aspects linked to the identification and enrollment of families with children from 0-5 years of age, as well as access to the benefit using the different payment systems. In addition, the report will include recommendations and an action plan to improve the design and delivery of accompanying measures, in light of the lessons learned from the pilot supported by UNICEF. 49. Within this activity, the project will also reflect the development of accompanying measures that can help the cash transfer program achieve their core objectives of improving the human capital of children and reducing the intergenerational transmission of poverty. There is significant evidence that cash transfers, combined with accompanying measures27 that foster behavioral changes in parenting 27 Large-scale parenting interventions, though few, have also proved to have positive impacts on children’s development, Page 23 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) practices to promote early childhood nutrition, psychosocial stimulation, or health have larger impacts on childhood development than cash transfer programs alone, and that these results are often more prominent among younger children. Based on the experience of the pilot supported by UNICEF, the project will be able to design and improve accompanying measures that can help parents to change their behaviors and overcome the constraints and barriers to human capital development of children further threatened by the consequences of the recent pandemic. These parenting programs will also stress the value of girls’ education and the involvement of fathers, which can help close the gender gap in ECD outlined above and have a larger involvement of fathers.28 In the Tunisian context, parenting programs can focus on information to raise awareness on prenatal and postnatal care, feeding practices, nutrition, child stimulation, positive discipline, and the value of preschool education. The implementation design will explore a series of platforms, including social marketing, text messages, specific sessions with beneficiaries facilitated in the community by trained social workers, community health care workers, or volunteers, which can be combined with follow up home visits. These types of activities will also build complementarity with existing arrangements and also leverage the Bank-financed project in basic education and in the health sector. 50. In addition, PBC#3 (US$6 million) will incentivize the sustainability of the expansion of the Family Allowance beyond the life of the project. Building on the results of the pilot evaluation and the proposed action plan, this PBC will support the adoption of a permanent expansion of Family Allowance to all 0 to 5-year-old children from households enrolled in the AMEN Social program. Specifically, it will include children of all beneficiaries of the AMEN Social program receiving PCT and those having a subsidized health card. Thus, the AMEN Social program will provide, in addition to health insurance, a cash transfer to all vulnerable households with children between 0 and 5 years. This will expand the coverage of cash transfer programs and promote the human capital of children. Component 3. Strengthening the Social Protection System (US$30.25 million) 51. Component 3 will strengthen the social protection system to deliver efficient and inclusive programs. This component will support: (a) the strengthening of Tunisia’s social protection system to deliver efficient and inclusive social assistance through the AMEN Social Program (i) the update of the scoring formula and the implementation of the full specification PM model of the new targeting system under the AMEN Social Program, (ii) the preparation and publication of annual reports of the AMEN Social Program and (iii) the strengthening of the digitalization of payments under the AMEN Social Program; and (iii) the enhancement of the performance of the social protection system through, inter alia: (a) the preparation of monitoring and evaluation reports and impact assessment(s); (b) the implementation of an outreach communication campaign and the carrying out of beneficiary monitoring survey(s). including cognition and skills, in both the USA[9] and Peru[10]. Positive impacts are not only expected for children but also for women, where evidence shows, for example, that CTs conditional on some behaviors are linked with decreases in domestic violence[11]. 28 Currently the share of parents involved in early childhood education varies greatly by gender of caregivers, with mothers (64.4 percent) and fathers (28.2percent) (REF). Page 24 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) 52. This component will finance the AMEN Social program on the achievement of PBCs #4, 5 and 6; see below. In addition, this component will finance activities that will focus on the improvement of targeting, communication/outreach strategies and GRM. 53. PBC#4 (US$5 million) aims to improve the targeting efficiency of the AMEN Social program by updating of the scoring formula and the use of the full specification of the PMT model. The new targeting tool based on the PMT formula is ready to be deployed for all new beneficiaries of the AMEN Social program.29 Welfare The technical work to design the PMT model was supported and reviewed by the Bank. The results show that the application of the PMT model will significantly improve the level of targeting performance compared to the current model. The analysis of the efficiency of the new scoring formula on real household data and feedback from potential beneficiaries through the GRM system will facilitate the implementation of a more efficient model, requiring both administrative data and information from household visits to assess their welfare. This approach will also allow the establishment of a continuous process of improvement of the targeting system for social programs, based on evidence and lessons learned. 54. PBC#5 (US$10 million) will incentivize the MOSA’s efforts to improve communication, monitoring and evaluation of the AMEN Social program through the preparation and publication of annual reports. The MOSA will prepare and publish a comprehensive report each year on the implementation of the AMEN Social program, including feedback from beneficiaries through IBM surveys and focus groups. In doing so, MOSA will systematically assess some of the main challenges in the AMEN Social program processes, evaluating strengths and weaknesses over the course of two years, and draw key lessons. 55. PBC#6 (US$5 million) will reinforce the digital payment infrastructure under the AMEN Social program. Experience from the first emergency response during 2020 showed that it is crucial to ensure rapid and safe delivery of payments to beneficiaries and avoid sanitary risks due to queuing for payments. In addition, the digital payment infrastructure will incorporate climate resilience design and ensure service continuity during climate events. Activities under this component will support using digital payments (i.e., mobile payments and ATM withdrawals, bank transfers, etc., depending on beneficiaries’ preferences) to reduce time and cost, and ensure a safe transfer for beneficiary households receiving PCT and Family Allowances. These activities will capitalize on the ongoing technical assistance provided by the World Bank to assess the existing digital payment infrastructure and make recommendations for improvement. 56. Component 3 will also finance activities on targeting, GRM, Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) studies, and communication, to further strengthen the performance of the social protection system (US$2.25 million). This component will finance studies, M&E reports, operational manuals and IBM phone surveys to assess the efficiency of the programs, receive feedback from beneficiaries and provide 29 This first PMT model was designed by CRES using the ENBCM 2015 from INS. Page 25 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) information on the implementation of the program and foster a continuous improvement of the social protection system. The rigorous monitoring and evaluation of processes will provide information on the performance of the social protection system and identify the effectiveness of the programs. These activities will allow Tunisia to ensure that it serves its poor and vulnerable households and their children in an efficient and cost-effective manner. These activities will also contribute to the development of national capacity for impact evaluation of the social programs. IBM surveys will provide disaggregated data by type of service, household and gender (covering all phases of the delivery system from outreach to payment and GRM processes). 57. The proposed project will finance a communication campaign, including through direct messaging to beneficiaries and eligible households, to ensure participation and program results. Communications will focus on the temporary nature of support for TCTs and the vertical/horizontal expansion of social safety nets for PCT (Components 1 and 2). Internal and external communications are essential to guarantee buy-in from all stakeholders for the reforms to the social protection system and its activities. In addition, outreach is crucial to make the TCT and PCT efficient and inclusive, as described in Component 1. This component will co-finance activities such as workshops, trainings and communication plans and activities. The implementation of these activities will capitalize on lessons learned during the first communication campaigns implemented in (i) 2019 after the validation and the publication of the AMEN Social Law, and (ii) 2020 to support mitigation measures during the COVID-19 crisis and lockdown. Component 4. CERC (US$0) 58. This component would provide immediate response to an eligible crisis or emergency, as needed. This component will allow the GOT to request the World Bank for a rapid allocation of project funds to the CERC to respond promptly and effectively to an eligible emergency or crisis. If the requirements for activation are met, the World Bank will reallocate resources from the disbursement categories of the project to the CERC category to finance eligible expenditures for the emergency response. Expenditures will be evaluated and reviewed to determine if they are acceptable to the World Bank prior to disbursement. Allocation of Funds by Components and Year 59. The proposed project will use direct expenditures and PBCs to incentivize achievement of results PDO, as outlined in Table 2. The operation will use direct expenditures to support the government's urgent response to the COVID-19 crisis during the second quarter of 2021. It will also support the existing PCT of the AMEN Social program to ensure that poor households will continue to receive the support they need during the second half of 2021 and in 2022. Support for the PCT will also cover the government's strategy to expand the coverage of benefit during this economic crisis. In addition, starting 2022, the operation will also finance the expansion of Family Allowances under the AMEN Social program. Finally, the planned technical activities, starting 2022, will strengthen the AMEN Social program and the overall social protection system to ensure the resilience of households. Page 26 of 86 The World Bank COVID-19 Social Protection Emergency Response Support Project (P176352) 60. The PBCs will be linked to the AMEN Social program’s recurrent expenditures. This program is the cornerstone of the support to the poor and vulnerable population and the reform strategy for the improvement of social protection system. The GOT recognizes the importance of this program and will continue to provide it with the budget needed to continue government operation of the program throughout the project period and beyond. The PBCs will incentivize the improvement of efficiency and the delivery of cash transfer benefits under AMEN Social program. The operation will finance the three budget lines of the AMEN Social program upon achievement of the expected results. PBC 1, under Component 1 will support the expansion of the PCT under the AMEN Social program using an improved targeting mechanism. The achievement of PBCs 2-3, under Component 2, will support the expansion and improvement of the Family Allowance benefit under the AMEN Social program. The achievement of PBCs 4, 5 and 6, under Component 3 will support the strengthening of the social protection system. All of the project activities listed in the table below are essential for the establishment of an integrated and functional delivery system to efficiently provide social protection services in climate vulnerable areas.
