STRATEGIC CONTEXT  \\n \\nA. Country Context  \\n1. Tanzania is a geographically large, diverse , and strategically important lower -middle -income country (LMIC) on \\nthe Indian Ocean. Out of 54 African countries, Tanzania is  the fifth largest in terms of population, the ninth largest in \\nterms of the size of economy ( for example, by gross domestic product [GDP ] in US  dollars ), and the thirteen th largest in \\nterms of geographical area.  Solid income growth over two decades has led the coun try to reach LMIC status in July 2020 . \\n \\n2. The graduation from low -income status reflects sustained macroeconomic and political stability as well as the \\ncountry’s rich natural resources endowment and strategic geographic position.  Macroeconomic stability has been \\ncrucial to Tanzania’s growth , inflation rates have been low , below 5 percent since 2018  and sustainable fiscal and \\ncurrent -account deficits have been financed by a combination of domestic and external sources. Over the past two \\ndecades, investment has been a key driver of economic growth . The rise in overall investment translated into a sustained \\naccumulation of capital stock and has consistently accounted for roughly two -thirds of real GDP growth .   \\n \\n3. COVID -19 has negatively impacted  Tanzania’s macroeconomic performance , decelerating GDP growth in 2020 , \\nalthough Tanzania is one of  the few economies  in the region  that  avoided  recession.1 The global economic slowdown \\nadversely affected Tanzania’s export -oriented industries, especially tourism and traditional exports, and has caused a \\ndrop in foreign investment. The exception is gold mining which has benefitted from rising prices since the onset of the \\npandemic.  Although  the government  did not impose  a lockdown,  the pandemic  initially spurred precautionary behaviors \\nthat slowed down domestic economic activity . \\n \\n4. Tanzania’s vulnerability to the global pandemic remains high, and risks are tilted to the downside. Under a \\nsevere outbreak, Tanzania’s health care system would become heavily strained, and social distancing would paralyze \\nmost manufacturing and services. In early 2020, the  Government of Tanzania (GoT) implemented critical measures \\naimed at containing the spread of COVID -19 and encouraged people to avoid unnecessary movements, practice hand \\nhygiene and social distancing, and identified several public and pr ivate  hospitals  that would  serve  as isolation  centers  for \\npeople  infected  with  COVID -19. The government reported COVID -19 cases only up to April 28, 2020. The availability of \\nofficial information on COVID -19 infection and mortality rates is important in assessing the effectiveness of national \\npublic health response. In February 2021, the Minister of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly, and \\nChildren restarted efforts to contain the pandemic, urging the general public to take precaut ionary  measures  against  the \\nspread  of infectious  diseases,  including  COVID -19, and urged  wearing of masks, avoiding overcrowding in hospitals, and \\ncontinued education of the population by health professionals . See Annex 6 for more details  of the  World Bank  Group  \\n(WBG ) response in Tanzania . \\n \\n5. The p overty  rate  in Tanzania has been declining gradually.  The national poverty headcount has improved  from \\n34.4 percent of population in 2007 to 28.2 percent in 2012 and further to 26.4 percent in 2018. Despite Tanzania’s \\nimpressive GDP growth between 2012 and 2018 , poverty reduction slowed, and growth has become less inclusive. \\nInequality has also risen during this period. The international poverty headcount ( US$1.90  per day at 2011 purchasing \\npower parity ) rema ined high and unchanged during this period, at 49 percent. With a Human Capital Index of 39 in 2020, \\nTanzania is ranked among the bottom 25 countries, at 152 out of 174 . \\n \\n6. Successful transition to middle -income status will require sustaining high growth whi le offering a more inclusive \\nset of economic opportunities to improve living standards for the majority of Tanzanians.  National aspirations laid out \\n \\n1 Tanzania Economic Update 15th Edition, 2021.   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 8 \\n \\nin the Tanzania Development Vision (TDV) 2025 are to transition to a middle -income country with a high leve l of human \\ncapital development, characterized by improvements in the quality of livelihood of the people. Tanzania has made \\nimprovements in life expectancy ; infant mortality ; primary and secondary school enrollment rates ; gender equality ; and \\naccess to hea lth, electricity, water, and sanitation. However, there is still a large agenda ahead to  sustaining growth over \\nthe medium term , improving the inclusiveness of growth to reduce poverty , and strengthening upward economic \\nmobility and economic security for t he population. Growth in Tanzania has been led by sectors that employ a small share \\nof the labor force. Insufficient job creation , low productivity , and high population growth , combined with a large \\ninfrastructure gap , and lack of access to digital opportu nities have hindered the inclusiveness of economic growth and  \\nprevent growth gains  to translate into poverty reduction .  \\n \\n7. Regardless of rapid urbanization, approximately 70 percent of the Tanzanian population still lives in rural areas, \\nwhere poverty is deeper when compared to the population in urban areas . While rural areas have reduced the \\nincidence of poverty faster than u rban areas, going from 33.4 percent to 31.3 percent from  2012 –2018, it is estimated \\nthat 80 percent of the poor and extreme poor live in the rural areas. Out of the 11.3 million rural poor, some 3.5 million \\nlive in extreme poverty . By contrast , in urban areas there are only 2.6 million poor, of which  745,000 live in  extreme \\npoverty . Furthermore, population keeps growing fast, adding approximately 1.5 million people annually, which puts \\npressure on the economy, natural resources, infrastructure  inclu ding digital , urban planning, and job creation.  \\n \\n8. Tanzania’s cost of adaptation  to current climate impacts is estimated at approximately US$500 million annually  \\nand, by 2030 , could increase to US$1 billion a year if no action is taken.2 Individual annual events have economic costs \\nin excess of 1 percent of GDP. Recognizing its vulnerability to climate impacts, the GoT adopted the National Climate \\nChange Strategy in 2012, a pl an that identifies climate change risks for 18 sectors and 12 cross -cutting areas, and it \\nproposes over 200 strategic interventions to mitigate risks . However, the implementation of climate -resilient \\napproaches and its integration in projects has been insu fficient. Currently, there  is a lack of action plans to address \\nclimate change for most sectors, and the country is already experiencing the problems related to inaction. As an \\nexample, important historical paper archives of birth registration are located close to the coast in Dar -es-Salaam and are \\nat risk from rising sea levels. Digiti zation of these paper archives will help to mitigate this risk.  \\n9. The Tanzania social context in rural settings is less favorable to women.  It is estimated that the losses in human \\ncapital wealth that can be attribute d to gender inequality in Tanzania are up to US$111 billion .3 Agriculture employs \\n56 percent of the total women labor force (76 percent in rural areas), but approximately 64 percent of them do not \\nreceiv e any kind of payment4. Furthermore, data show the prevalence of different forms of violence against women in \\nTanzania . The 2015 –2016 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and Malaria Indicator Survey (2015 –2016) \\nreveals that 39.5  percent  of women, age s 15–49 years, have experienced one or more acts of physical violence since age \\n15; rural women are more likely to experience any form of physical violence (41.8  percent ) than urban women (35.5  \\npercent ). \\n10. A faster path for economic growth will  be largely dependent on the swift actions and policies decided in the \\nshort and medium term.  Efforts linked to job creation and support ing the  rural population with improved access to \\nhealth and educational services and enhancement of the sectoral conditi ons for agriculture to improve food security will \\nbe critical. In this context, the planned activity under the project  to extend mobile broadband coverage in rural areas \\n \\n2 World Bank Group. 2015. “Financing Climate -Resilient Growth in Tanzania.” Environment and Natural Resources Global Practice Policy Note. \\nWorld Bank, Washington, DC.  https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/1 0986/23251 License: CC BY 3.0 IGO.  \\n3 World Bank. 2019. “Tanzania Economic Update.

According to the 2017 survey of mobile phone usage, the constraint  of lack of coverage, as a reason \\nfor non -phone ownership, is  almost five times higher in rural areas than in urban ones.5 \\nB. Sectoral and Institutional Context  \\n11. The digital economy is a key driver of Tanzania’s future growth and prosperity.6 The country  has had a \\ncompetitive telecommunications market since the early 1990s and currently counts three mobile operators which each \\nhave  at least 25 percent of the mobile market by subscribers (Vodacom, Airtel , and Tigo) and three other players with \\nsmaller shares (Halotel , Zantel , and Tanzania Telecommunications Corporation Limited [ TTCL ]).7 Tanzania has made \\nsignificant progress in improving connectivity and access to digital financial services over the past decade  which \\ncontributes to economic growth and financial inclusion . According to the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority \\n(TCRA)8, by the end of 2020, mobile phone (voice) penetration had risen to 51.3  million  (88.4 subscriptions per 100 \\ninhabitants ). The number of active mobile money accounts at the end of 2020 was around 32.3  million, and the value of \\ndigital financial transactions  in 2019 was  equivalent to nearly 50 percent of total GDP (Annex 2, Tables 7 and 8). \\nFurthermore, at least half a million people are employed as mobile money agents , which creates both direct and indirect \\njobs for citizens . Following the launch of 3G/4G services in major population centers, access to the internet, particularly \\nmobile broad band, has recently begun to take off . The TCRA estimated around  28.4 million  users ( 49.0  per 100 \\ninhabitants ) at the end of 2020, and the government is aiming for 8 0 percent penetration by the year 2025 . These \\nachievements have been driven by both public a nd private investments in telecommunications infrastructure and digital \\nservice delivery, particularly within the highly competitive mobile telecom market. In sectors with significant \\ninfrastructure deficits, such as energy and transport, the spread of mob ile connectivity and financial services is further \\nunlocking opportunities for new services and business models through rapid growth of distributed rural electrification \\ninitiatives  by the Rural Energy Agency (REA)  and ICT innovations in delivery  of government services . It is expected that \\nthis project will help unlock further opportunities and hence increase government revenue and private sector growth , \\nespecially by attaining the target of 8 0 percent broadband internet penetration by 2025, to which component  2 of the \\nproject  will make a major contribution .  \\n12. A number of interrelated factors are constraining private sector investment and competitiveness critical to \\nclosing Tanzania’s digital divide and creating a str ong foundation for growth of the digital economy. These include:  \\n \\n(a) Underinvestment in backbone network infrastructure . Low cost, high quality , and geographically widespread \\nfiber -optic backbone networks are essential for provi ding  telecom services. To date, the National ICT \\nBroadband Backbone (NICTBB) has deployed 7,910 km of fiber, with an expansion to 15,000 km targeted by \\n2025 . The network has too few loops  to create sufficient redundancy to protect from cuts, especially for cross -\\nborder links. High prices for right s-of-way further deter investment .9 Prices for wholesale capacity have \\nrecently been reduced to enhance usability and c ompetitiveness. The government , through the regulatory \\nauthority (TCRA) , needs to deploy an open access  policy to allow competition and to encourage more \\ninnovation in the use of  existing infrastructures. There are initiatives taken by the government , such as the \\nmetro loops , which have granted operators access and fair use, hence more competition and usability in the \\n \\n5 World Bank. 2020.

As pa rt of the transaction, the Government of Zanzibar may relinquish its 15 \\npercent stake in Zantel.

The government needs to allow such initiatives to  further  open up the market.  \\n \\n(b) Low levels of income, digital literacy , and domestic market size . Consumers of ICT services are highly price \\nsensitive given the low levels of average income in Tanzania. Combined  with aggressive competition in the \\nmobile retail market, this has led to low marginal revenues for service providers,  which  discourages investment \\nin infrastructure and services in rural areas where there isn’t a sufficient customer base to overcome the low \\nmargins.  \\n \\n13. The Regional Communications Infrastructure Program Phase 3 in Tanzania (RCIP -TZ) has played a critical role in \\nincreasing connectivity for citizens and the government and enabling digital transactions.  The RCIP -TZ (P111432 ; 2009 –\\n2017) contributed to a dramatic reduction in the cost of wholesale international connectivity, inc luding a 99  percent \\ndrop in pricing from US$10,000 per E1 connection in 2008 to US$110 by the end of 2015, with available international \\nbandwidth increasing from 302  Mbps in 2008 to 47,010 Mbps by June 2016.10 These developments have led to lower \\nretail pr ices and better quality of ICT services for consumers and businesses. An additional 2.6 million people in 1,393 \\npreviously unconnected rural villages now have mobile (typically 2G) coverage through public -private partnerships \\nfacilitated through the RCIP -TZ and the Universal Communications Service Access Fund (UCSAF), helping to narrow the \\ndigital divide. Around  72 Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and 77 Local Government Authorities (LGAs) are \\nnow connected to high -speed broadband through the Government Network (GovNet), enabling high -quality electronic \\ncommunications, record keeping , and digital service delivery.  \\n \\n14. Despite this progress, Tanzania is nevertheless not fulfilling  its potential for harnessing digital communications \\nand technologie s for economic growth, job creation , and service delivery.  The country was ranked 167 out of 175 \\ncountries in 2018 in the International Telecommunication Union’s (ITU) ICT Development Index , down from 139 in \\n2011 .11 In the ITU’s Global Cybersecurity Index , Tanzania ranked 69th globally in 2018 . The ICT sector accounts for a mere \\n2 percent of GDP, compared with at least 3 percent (and typically more) in similar countries, representing a gap \\nestimated at a minimum of US$450 million for eac h percentage shortfall. Tanzania also lags its neighbors in terms of \\ntake -up of 3G and 4G mobile broadband services. Despite progress in extending rural connectivity, a significant digital \\ndivide persists, with at least three million people living in areas  still without any mobile signal (according to the Global \\nSystem for Mobile Communications Association  [GSMA ]), and more than 18 million people without data coverage, \\nessential to connect to the internet .12 Even  in areas with sufficient signal coverage, mobile broadband services remain \\nunaffordable to much of the population, with tariffs for a basic plan (500 MB per month) equivalent to 10 percent of \\ngross national income ( GNI) per capita. This is twice the Unite d Nations ( UN)-endorsed affordability benchmark of 5 \\npercent or less (UN Broadband Commission). The reasons for this are explored further in annex 3.  \\n \\n15. Furthermore, there is a disconnect between the formal education system and the skills required in the ma rket, \\nparticularly for women . This is a common refrain from companies in the ICT sector. The formal education system is \\ntargeted toward academic performance rather than job -related skills, particularly those required for the success of the \\ndigital economy. As a result, companies have to invest heavily to train recruits, and, in many cases, recently  trained \\nprofessionals are poached by competitors or migrate to other countries to seek work; thus, companies need to \\nconstantly train new recruits. The W orld Economic Forum estimated in 2017 that 41 percent of all firms in Tanzania \\nidentified an inadequately skilled workforce as a major constraint, compared to 30 percent in Kenya, 9 percent in South \\nAfrica , and 6 percent in Nigeria. Furthermore, the countr y has a 10 percent gender gap in labor force participation. To \\nmake an impact, a comprehensive and gender -inclusive digital skills program needs to be developed.13 Other aspects of \\n \\n10 As of Dec ember  2020, total international internet bandwidth to Tanzania had expanded further to 3 76 Gbit/s (source: TeleGeography Inc.) . \\n11 ITU (Internat ional Telecommunication Union). 201 9.

The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 11 \\n \\nthe gender gap that this project is seeking to address include a lack of se x-disaggregated data, lack of institution capacity \\nfocused on gender, gender gaps in device ownership , and a lack of awareness of digital services available to women. The \\nways in which the project is designed to address these challenges are highlighted in Annex 7.  \\n \\n16. However, if the digital economy is to rapidly expand and respond effectively to the COVID -19 pandemic, there \\nare a number of interventions that the GoT can consider . These include moves to make mobile money and low -value \\ndata packages affordable for the poor and to increase participation of citizens in digital f inancial services . Investment in \\nenhanced coverage of mobile broadband in rural areas is particularly necessary  to reduce the digital divide.14 To \\nstimulate progress toward integration in the global digital economy, the Go T should continue  to attract carrier -neutral \\ndata centers and content distribution networks, in addition to ensuring an ena bling environment to encourage operators \\nto invest more in underserved areas . As physical trade declines as a result of COVID -19 restrictions, the Go T should also \\nmove to facilitate digital trade, primarily by passing a strong data protection act15 with supportive regulations and \\nreviewing how intellectual property is protected online, providing an enhancement of the enabling environment for \\ndigital platforms and usability.  It is expected that the eCom merce  Initiative under sub-component 1.2c  of the project will \\nstrengthen the enabling environment for digital trade and allow for better competitive platforms.   \\n \\nC. Relevance to Higher Level Objectives  \\n17. The GoT is seeking to promote digital development as a key enabler of economic growth and industrialization, \\njob creation, service delivery , and government efficiency . The F ive Year Development Plan (FYD P)  III 2021/22 –2025/26 \\nrecognizes that the digital economy creates “many new economic opportunities” and “ paves the way for Tanzania to \\nleverage digitization in growing her digital economy pie and, most importantly, in accelerating economic transformation ” \\nwith the ICT sector playing a leading role in the “fourth industrial revolution”. The FYDP III sets a target of ensuring that \\nbroadband internet reaches 80 percent of citizens by 2025, with universal mobile broadband coverage by the same date. \\nThe goal is t o raise the estimated contribution of the communication sector from 1.5 to 3 percent of GDP by 2025. In its \\nletter of November 12, 2020, t he GoT also recognized the Digital Tanzania Project (DTP)  as one of the priority projects it \\nwished to  implement under IDA -19.  \\n \\n18. In addition to the  ICTs’  direct impact on GDP growth, the GoT has recognized that digital technologies can play a \\nstrong role in boosting growth across the econom y. In 2016 mobile operators alone contributed over US$2.5 billion, \\nthe equivalent of 5.2 percent of GDP. The TDV 2025  states that the ICT sector should be “harnessed persistently in all \\nsectors of the economy ” and that this demands that “adequate investments are made .” National ICT Policy 2016  \\nemphasizes the role of the private sector in financing ICT infrastructure and design ing “collaborative frameworks \\nbetween ICT investors and the government .” The WB Country Partnership Framework ( CPF), covering the period \\nFY18 /19–FY22 /23,16 recognizes that : (a) to achieve its ambitious economic development and industrialization goals, \\nTanzania must equip its citizens and businesses to flourish in the digital economy or risk being left behind; ( b) digital \\ntechnologies can create ladders of opportunity and transform access to services and information for marginalized \\npeople; and ( c) modern ICT infrastructure and digital platforms are vital to make public institutions more efficient, \\ntransparent, and accountable.  \\n \\n19. The project is aligned with the World Bank ’s (WB)  Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) initiative17, which is \\n \\n14 It appea rs that the number of ‘whitespots ’ (where cellular signals are not available) may be higher than the statistics reported by operators \\nsuggest , based on evidence from alternative sources, such as OpenSignal.com.  \\n15 These pol icy issues are explored in more de tail in : World Bank. 2020.

The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 12 \\n \\nsupporting the implementation of the African Union’s Digital Transformation Strategy for Africa , 2020 -2030 , 18 and \\ncontributing to the WBG ’s twin goals of shared prosperity and reduced poverty. The Digital Transformation Strategy for \\nAfrica sets out a bold vision that calls for every African individual, business, and government to be digitally enabled by \\n2030, in or der to drive the digital transformation of Africa and ensure its full participation in the global digital economy. \\nA well -functioning digital economy can help accelerate achievement of the W BG’s twin goals of shared prosperity and \\nreduced poverty. Activiti es under sub-component 2.2, to extend coverage of mobile broadband to rural areas , will help in \\nalleviating poverty, while the efforts to strengthen digital small and medium enterprises (SMEs) under component 1 will \\ncontribute to shared prosperity . With a well-functioning digital economy, countries can achieve inclusive and faster \\neconomic growth, offer innovative products and services, create jobs and export revenue, and achieve greater \\ninternational competitiveness  (see annex 3). The Go T will need to invest in organizational reforms, improving the skills of \\nthe public sector, and in transforming how it delivers services by using ICT more effectively. The Tanzania CPF FY18 /19–\\nFY22 /23 supports this effort by helping to identify and implemen t automated processes that reduce transaction costs \\nwithin the government and in the public sector’s interface with citizens and businesses and minimize scope for \\ndiscretionary behavior by public officials. Such technology -based service enhancements, for i nstance, will complement \\nthe development of one  stop service centers  (OSSCs) . The project will contribute to all three focus areas of the CPF, but \\nin particular to focus area 1, on enhancing productivity and accelerating equitable and sustainable growth, n otably \\nthrough the efforts being undertaken in the project to stimulate digital entrepreneurship ( Component 1) and to ensure \\nthat all parts of the country benefit from mobile broadband coverage ( Sub-component 2.2). Indeed, the implementation \\nof the project will bring benefits to all parts of the WBG portfolio in Tanzania (see annex 2, table 10).   \\n \\n20. The project will consider any potentially negative climate impact arising from the implementation of act ivities \\nwhile seek ing to accelerate positive climate potential in project activities.  In Tanzania, as elsewhere, increasing \\ndigitization has a positive as well as potentially adverse climate impact. While increasing energy consumption drive s \\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, digital technologies can also be used to warn vulnerable populations about natural \\ndisasters (for instance, by extending mobile internet to rural areas, under sub-component 2.2)  and to reduce transport \\nneeds and hence emiss ions (through the extended availability of government online service delivery through sub-\\ncomponent 3.3) . The project will, whenever possible, choose climate -friendly options to mitigate impact and improve \\nresilience, including amongst other things climate -friendly infrastructure choices, ICT refurbishment with a focus on e -\\nwaste management, and employing public ICT services to enhance climate resilience. These choices are fully aligned \\nwith Tanzania’s national climate strategy and the W B’s Africa Climate B usiness Plan.   \\n \\n21. Every economy in Africa was hit hard in 2020 by the COVID -19 pandemic, though expected country -specific \\nmagnitudes remain highly uncertain .19 As of April 4 , 2021, there were  around  216,000  cases in the region resulting in \\nover 3 ,000 deaths to date.20 Although project preparation started before the pandemic struck, its design has been \\nadapted to provide a digital response to COVID -19 (see annex  6). Due to this pandemic outbreak , the country cannot \\nescape the impact on the wider region which has seen economic growth rates plunge . \\n  \\n \\n18 African Union . 2020.

Project Development Objective  \\nPDO Statement  \\n \\nThe Project Development Objective (PDO) is t o increase access to high quality broadband internet services for \\ngovernment , businesses  and citizens, and to improve the government\\'s capacity to deliver digital public services.  \\n \\nPDO  Level Indicators  \\n \\n22. Achievement of the PDO will be measured by the following PDO  Level results indicators:   \\na) IDA-19 Access Indicator . Percentage of the population covered by a mobile broadband network signal (3G, 4G \\nor higher) . \\nb) Government Access Indicator . Number of Government Ministries, Departments and Agencies  benefitting from \\nbroadband  internet  service .  \\nc) IDA-19 Citizen Access Indicator . Individuals (aged 15 and above) using the internet , per 100 inhabitants, of which \\npercentage female . \\nd) Digital Public Services Indicator . Number of  monthly  transactions accessing a public service via internet or a \\nmobile phone . \\n \\nB. Project Components  \\n23. The DTP is structured around four  components , three of which  seek to contribute to core enablers of digital \\ndevelopment : (a) The Digital Ecosystem : strengthening the laws, policies, regulations, institutional capacity, and human \\ncapacity needed to promote ICT infrastructure investment, market competitiveness, digital engagement, job creation, \\nand innovation; ( b) Digital Connectivity : ensuring access to affordable, high -quality internet services for all citizens, \\nincluding in rural areas, and for critical government institutions; ( c) Digital Platforms and Services : building the technical \\ncapacity, skills, institutions, and local digita l infrastructure for the Government to deliver services to citizens and conduct \\nits own business digitally . A fourth component  (d) supports Project Management . Unallocated contingency funding has \\nalso been set aside.  A summary budget is provided in table  1 (more  detail in table 9 of annex 2 ).  \\nComponent 1: Digital Ecosystem (U S$28.7  million  equivalent ) \\n \\n24. This component aims to make Tanzania a more attractive and competitive place for digital investment and \\ninnovation, ensuring that the benefits of digital technology are reaching all citizens and helping lay the groundwork for \\ngrowth of the digital economy. This will be accom plished by strengthening the many interrelated elements that \\ncharacterize a thriving digital ecosystem , helping the Go T in drafting forward -looking laws, regulations , and policies; \\nbuilding digital skills and capacity of government institutions and youth; prioritizing gender inclusivity (see annex 7) and \\ndeveloping a critical mass of innovators, entrepreneurs, and support services; developing a robust local ICT industry that \\nis founded on private investment and is able to deliver e -Commerce services ; streng thening cybersecurity capacity to \\nprevent, detect , and respond to cyberattacks  and improving data protection and privacy ; and working toward closing \\nthe digital divide , ensuring that all citizens and businesses benefit from digital development in the long term, especially \\nthe poor, women, the elderly , and communities in rural areas. Two sub -components will support t hese goals . \\n \\n  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 14 \\n \\n1.1. Digital Enabling Environment (US$ 13.4 million  equivalent ) \\n \\na) Establishment of a National Center for ICT Professional Development and Innovation (US$ 10.0 million ) \\n \\n25. The objective of this activity is to develop a national center for ICT professional development and a series of ‘soft \\ncenters ’, or tech hubs for youth, entrepreneurs , and SMEs , in five zones of the country, to promote local innovation in \\nthe country. The implementation of this activity will be carried out by MCIT in collaboration with higher learning \\ninstitutions  (HLIs) , vocational training institutions , and the industry, as wel l as with the Ministry of Education, Science \\nand Technology (M oEST) and the Co mmission  for Science and Technology (COSTECH) . This activity  will require close \\ncollaboration with the private sector to ensure  that newly trained ICT professionals are ready to enter the workforce \\nand have the qualifications and soft skills demanded by private sector companies, including cybersecurity awareness \\nand skills. The project will specifically address the facilitation needed by women to enable them to attend the training , \\ntrack the involvement of women in benefitting from the training provided, and promot e internships for young women \\nunder the government -funded program for youth employment. Direct collaboration with the private sector will be \\nsought, including by way of specific on -the-job training programs or internships provided by the soft centers. The \\nnational center will be established at th e ICT Commission in Dodoma , while  four soft  cent ers will be housed in training \\ninstitutions or universities. The soft  cent ers will be located in four zones , namely the Northern, Southern, Coastal , and \\nWestern zones. The soft  centers w ill be assisted in developing cost -recovery mechanisms for the services they offer and \\nwill need to establish good relations with private sector clients to establish longer -term sustainability, once the project \\nfunds are fully used.   \\n \\nb) Establishment of Fabrication Laboratories  (US$3.0  million  equivalent ) \\n \\n26. This activity aims to establish  Fabrication Lab oratories  (FabLabs ) to enhance local capacity for the refurbishment \\nof ICT hardware and updating of software to enable the reuse and increased lifetime of ICT equipment and to \\ncomplement efforts to distribute ICT equipment to educational institutions. This will contribute toward the acquisition \\nof low -cost ICT equipment for learning purposes. In addition, establishing FabLabs will reduce e -waste and build capacity \\nin Tanzania for reusing and prolonging the lifespan of ICT equipment, which is an important future strategy for tackling \\ne-waste.  Up to thre e FabLabs would be established and they  will need to develop cost -recovery mechanisms and seek \\nprivate sector support for the placement of beneficiaries to ensure longer -term viability. The soft centers and fab labs \\nare expected to promote digital entrepreneurship and the results framework will track the number of digital businesses \\nthat are created or sustained through the project, as well as number of jobs created, including the increas e in the number \\nof female employees.  \\n \\nc) ICT regulatory scan and review (US$0. 4 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n27. Under this activity, the MCIT, in cooperation with the TCRA and in consultation with the licensed operators and \\nwith the help of consultants  funded from the project , will conduct a scan of the legal and policy environment to identify \\npossible gaps that might be hindering the development of the digital economy in Tanzania and to review possible \\nresponses. This will target broadband implementati on and provide recommendations on any new initiatives that may \\nbe necessary to create an enabling regulatory, legal , and fiscal environment for the digital economy. The activity will \\nlook at national statements of digital policy and look at legislation und er development, such as on data protection  or \\nfreedom of information. It will benchmark the status of digital economy development in Tanzania against other countries \\nin the region. Under this activity, the M CIT will also convene with the TCRA  and the Ministry of Health, Community \\nDevelopment, Gend er, Elders and Children to ensure that gender considerations and the needs of women are integrated \\ninto this regulatory scan of the digital economy (see annex 7). The results of this regulatory scan should provide inputs  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 15 \\n \\nto the implementation of other comp onents , notably  sub-component 2.2. on rural connectivity.  Activities to be funded \\nunder this sub -component will include consultants and the costs associated with stakeholder consultations . \\n \\n1.2.        Infrastructure to support National ICT Development and e -Commerce (US$1 5.3 million  equivalent ) \\n \\na) Enhancing the national addressing and postcode system (US$1 2.0 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n28. This is an ongoing activity  which will scale up the pilot projects for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), \\nalready started and managed by the TCRA, which currently covers 66 wards21. This initiative is expected to cover an \\nadditional 711 wards from 37 councils , which includes capital cities, strategic areas, central business districts , and other \\nhigh -revenue -generating areas. The activities under this initiative involve development of digital maps , naming of \\nroads/streets and installation of signage and house num ber plates; data collection; enhance ment /update of the national \\nAddress Database , prepar ation /review of policies and regulations , ICT works , and awareness and capacity building. The \\nNSDI, or digitized map with multiple different layers, will provide a plat form on which information can be layered to \\nsupport key activities such as the national digital identification ( ID) and spatial maps for national development , taking \\ninto account requirements for data protection . The fieldwork for the mapping would be carried out under the guidance \\nof the MCIT,  TCRA , and Tanzania Post s Corporatio n (TPC) . Ground mapping and photography would be supplemented \\nby commercial firms recruited competitively to assist with digital mapping using remote sensing data from satellites and \\naerial photography. Activities to be funded would include supply of good s, consultancy services , and coverage of \\noperational costs.  \\n \\nb) Development of a national ICT statistical information management system (US$2.0  million  equivalent ) \\n \\n29. This activity aims to provide complete, accurate , and current statistical data for ICT in the country to support policy \\ndecisions for national development. This data would be collected, for instance, by carrying out household ICT surveys, \\nbuilding on the survey carried out in 2017 by the WBG in conjuncti on with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), with \\nfunding from the Digital Development Partnership (DDP)22 used by the NBS for national reporting. The surveys will track \\nusage trends by gender, age, wealth, education and urban/rural status. The results  framework will record  the number \\nof respondents, above the age of 15, who are internet users, of which the percentage who are female. In addition, it will \\nfacilitate investment growth in the ICT sector by providing useful data to potential investors.  The funding will be used to \\ndevelop an electronic management system, establish necessary frameworks for  enhancing ICT statistics availability , and \\ncommission further surveys for key ICT indicators under the guidance of the NBS.   \\n \\nc) E-Commerce initiatives for Tanzania Post s Corporation  (US$1.3  million  equivalent ) \\n \\n30. This activity is intended to assist the TPC to catch up with recent technological developments and participate more \\nactively in the delivery of e -Commerce. The initiative will later allow integration with global e -Commerce including the \\nUniversal Postal Union’s (UPU) Ecom@Africa initiative . The initiative seeks to make Tanzania a hub for e -Commerce in \\nthe region and will enhance e -business growth and the participation of citizens in the digital economy.   \\n \\n31. While specific priority activities have been identified, the design of the component is intended to remain flexible, \\nallowing the project to respond to new challenges and opportunities as they arise in this fast -changing sector. There may \\nbe a requirement for some additional enabling legislation to promote the development of e -Commerce in Tanzania, and \\nthis will be tracked under the regulatory scan in sub-component 1.1c. Th is sub -component will primarily finance \\n \\n21 http://www.address.go.tz/  \\n22 The DDP is a trust fund managed by the World Bank.

More detail s are provided in annex 2.   \\n \\nComponent 2. Digital Connectivity (US$ 62.5 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n32. The government’s  aim is to ensure that 80 percent of  Tanzanians can access high -speed broadband connectivity  \\nby 2025 , in line with the Go T’s target . Widespread, affordable , and reliable connectivity is an essential prerequisite to \\nproviding and accessing digital services for socioeconomic development , and the wider digital economy . In addition to \\nthe measures to boost sector competitiveness and private  network investment under component 1, there is a need for \\nmore direct investment to meet the connectivity needs of the government and the private sector and to create \\nincentives for the private sector to close the digital divide in internet service provision between urban and rural \\npopulations . This component will support the Go T’s agenda for industrialization and equitable spatial development, \\nensuring that all Tanzanians, including those in rural areas, have equivalent access to digital services an d opportunities. \\nThis will be supported through two sub -components (for more details, see annex 2) .  \\n \\n2.1 Connected Government  (US$ 33.0 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n33. This sub -component will support the connection to high -speed broadband of those MDAs, LGAs , and other \\ngovernment institutions that are current ly unconnected, or have only slow -speed connections to the GovNet. This sub -\\ncomponent will build on the successful connectivity program initiated under the RCIP -TZ, under which around  72 MDAs \\nand 77 LGAs w ere connected to GovNet. This sub -component aims to connect a further 200 institutions including LGAs, \\nregional office s, regional hospitals, district hospitals , and other MDAs to high -performance internet services.  Given that \\nthe extension of digital connectivity within the country is paramount, a reliable and robust ICT backbone infrastructure \\nas well as a strong governance, technical , and operational framework  and capacity development for the security of the \\nbackbone, GovNet , and their connected networks from cyberattacks, hijacking , and breaches  is a necessity . In view of \\nthis, the project will support the enhancement of GovNet to provide resilience routes as well as the exten sion of  \\ncoverage of the national backbone to areas needed by telecom operators and other communication service providers \\nfor provision of services to citizens and businesses.    \\n \\n34. Furthermore, the DTP  will fund the pre -purchase of bulk internet capacity of at least 1.5 Gbps per location for \\n10 years ( that is , as an ‘indefeasible right of use ’ [IRU] contract ). The capacity will be used by MDAs and LGAs to facilitate \\ngovernment service delivery.  The pre -purchase of international bandwidth in bulk will aggregate demand from  priority \\nuser groups —schools, universities, hospitals, eGovernment use , and so on . Supporting access to cheaper capacity for \\nthese targeted user groups will allow them to grow their consumption in line with their actual demand (currently \\nconstrained by the prohibitive cost of capacity). This in turn will increase the viability of international infrastructure an d \\nin particular increase the usage of submarine cable infrastructure . The pre -purchase of bandwidth would be carried out \\nthrough competitive tendering for IRU contracts , which would be carried out in lots, with one lot covering the provision \\nof international internet bandwidth and other lots covering different regions of th e country (for instance, four zones, to \\nbe awarded in phases). The preferred technology to connect the government institutions would be fiber -optic cable, but \\nwhere this is not immediately available, temporary solutions using microwave, satellite , or 4G mo bile broadband could \\nbe considered. The bandwidth contracts on offer from GoT should provide an incentive for operators to upgrade their \\nnetworks to fiber over time. Companies winning the contracts funded under the project  would be required to apply \\nreleva nt WB Environmental and Social Framework  (ESF)  standards for all construction works carried out to extend their \\nnetworks in the zones served under the project.  Although the lease of capacity would extend for ten years, any \\noperations and maintenance costs that go beyond the closing date of the project , as well as additional bandwidth  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 17 \\n \\npurchased after the closing date,  would fall under  the responsibility of the GoT. Therefore , steps should be taken to \\nimplement cost recovery mechanisms among user MDAs.  \\n \\n2.2 Rural Broadband for Development (US$ 29.5 million  equivalent ) \\n35. This sub -component will build on the successful rural connectivity program supported under the RCIP -TZ by \\nextending data -enabled ( 3G or higher) network coverage to the three million people currently living in areas of the \\ncountry that are currently unserved by any mobile cellular signal and will upgrade existing 2G networks to 3G and above. \\nThis will encourage participation in digital e conomy development and will help those rural areas that have previously \\nbeen unable to participate in online learning or remote meetings to do so. This follow up program will be conducted in \\ncollaboration with the UCSAF and will draw upon lessons learned from the RCIP -TZ program, for instance to refine the \\ndelivery mechanisms for incentives to encourage private sector investment in rural areas by using national  roaming.23 \\nThe activity will also make use of ‘Television  White Spaces  (TVWS) ’ spectrum for enhancing broadband coverage in the \\nunderserved areas. This will require a consultant study to provide (i) a thorough spectrum analysis t hat will help  visualize \\nthe sc ope for using TV WS spectrum in rural areas and (ii) policy and regulatory guidance on the use of this spectrum  and \\nlicense coverage .  \\n \\n36. The proposed mechanism is a ‘reverse auction subsidy ’, similar to the one used under the RCIP -TZ and as used in \\nmultiple WB programs , such as the Niger Smart Villages for Rural Growth and Digital Inclusion (P167543) and Digital \\nMalawi Program Phase 1 (P160533). The UCSAF would designate geographical zones (in clusters or lots) where interested \\nbidders (such as mobile  operators, cell tower companies, high -altitude platform services , and so on ) would be invited to \\nbid competitively for the lowest viable subsidy to capital expenditure  (CAPEX)  that would be required for them to \\nprovide, or upgrade, service in the designat ed zones. Thus, project  funding would be used alongside  funds from the \\nUCSAF (using funds contributed to the Universal Service Fund  [USF] ) and would leverage funds from the private sector, \\nunder a maximizing financing for development  (MFD) approach. Under the RCIP -TZ program, a  WB-financed  contribution \\nof US$30  million  leveraged private sector investment of around US$70  million  and brought around  2.5 million people \\nunder mobile signal coverage for the first time. This would be a significant contribution to private capital mob ilization \\n(PCM)  from the project, but these sums are not included in the data sheet because the leveraged amount  will only be  \\nknown once the bidding process is completed and because there is no commitment or requirement from the private \\nsector to contribute a specific amount. A further challenge to extending rural broadband is the fact that mobile phone \\nuse is generally in advan ce of rural electrification. Under the RCIP -TZ, solar power arrays with battery storage  were used  \\nand will be supported also under the DTP . Rural electrification initiatives carried out by the REA should  be additionally \\nbeneficial to the program , and where possible  renewable technologies will be u sed.  \\n \\n37. Activities to be funded under this sub -component include : (a) a study on the scope for using TVWS spectrum; (b) \\na study to define the modality to be used for the reverse subsidy auctions, to define  a program operational manual to \\ngovern awards, and to monitor the implementation of awards; and ( c) a series of reverse subsidy auctions, open to \\ncompetitive bidding, in areas designated by the UCSAF. Winning bidders benefitting from CAPEX  subsidies under the \\nproject would be obliged to abide by relevant WB safeguards standards in any civil works carried out ( for example , \\nconstruction of cell towers).   \\n \\n \\n23 Under national roaming, the company providing rural connectivity in a particular zone would allow other cellular operators to  market t heir own \\nservices in that zone without requiring payment of roaming charges. The firm undertaking the investment may typically be gran ted a short period \\nof exclusivity of 1 –2 years before competing firms are allowed into the market. The national roaming me chanism was researched under field trials \\nled by the GSMA in Tanzania, as documented in: GSMA (Global System for Mobile Communications Association). 2018.

Component 3 seeks to enhance the core infrastructure and capacity necessary to support digital public service \\ndelivery, increase  the efficiency of the Go T’s internal operations , and roll  out priority digital productivity platforms and \\npublic services.  \\n \\n39. Progress has been made in recent years in developing digital services and elements of a shared services platform \\n(mobile services portal, short message service [SMS ] gateway, government e lectronic payment gateway  [GePG] , and so \\non); strengthening the e -Government Authority  (eGA) ; and deploy ing digital productivity tools for government (first \\nphase of e -Office, introduction of one -stop government digital service delivery centers [Huduma  Jamii  Centers ], initial \\ndigitalization of records, revenue management, and so on ). However, various MDAs and LGAs still operate stand -alone \\nICT systems and infrastructure, spending considerable financial and human resources  (HR)  to develop, implement, and \\noperate each s eparate digital service. This fragmented approach risks creating cybersecurity vulnerabilities in non -\\nstandardized systems . It also  creates significant financial, operational , and security liabilities for institutions that are ill-\\nsuited to cope with them.  In addition, the Go T lacks sufficient HR to meet increasing IT demands and adequate policies, \\npractices , and an effective IT infrastructure to deploy high -quality digital services in a fast, secure, reliable , and cost -\\neffective manner, under a ‘whole -of-government ’ approach. Developing ICT skills under this sub -component is intended \\nto serve government institutions and industrial sectors that are  in need of high skills for operations underway in the \\ncountry.  \\n \\n40. Increased  access to affordable, high -quality connectivity will create an opportunity to enhance the way the GoT \\nconducts its business and provides services to citizens using digital technologies. Offering public services through mobile \\nand online platforms can crea te significant benefits to citizens , who might otherwise need to travel long distances and \\nspend significant time and resources to access those services. This is particularly important for Tanzania’s rural residents , \\nwho may lack access to public transport  and quality roads but are much more likely to have access to a mobile phone. \\nLikewise, digital platforms offer opportunities to deliver new categories of services and transactions , such as digital cash \\ntransfers under social protection or payroll schemes,  lower administrative and logistical barriers to service delivery, and \\nreduce scope for corruption. Component 3 will include three  sub-components  (see annex 2 for more detail s).  \\n \\n3.1  Digital Services and Productivity Platforms (US$ 29.5  million ) \\n \\na) One-Stop Service Centers ( OSSC ) (US$2 1.5 million ) \\n \\n41. This activity will seek to improve existing processes and procedures for offering government services to citizens \\nand small businesses by establishing 31 OSSC s (or Huduma Jamii  in Swahili), of which up to 10 will be implemented in \\nthe first two years of the project ( eight  on the mainland ; two in Zanzibar).  These centers will be designed for citizens to \\naccess public services in a simple, speedy , and seamless manner in one locati on, which may be operated, for instance , \\nby a post office, a community association , or a local entrepreneur. A feasibility study  that was completed in November \\n202024 with funding from the African Development Bank  (AfDB)  provided recommendations for the implementation of \\nthis activity and the location of the OSSCs.  The study notes that, currently, to establish a business, an entrepreneur \\nwould need to visit five separa te parts of government ( Business Registration and Licensing Agency [ BRELA ], Tanzania \\nRevenue Authority [ TRA], relevant ministry , LGA, and Ministry of Industry  and Trade  (MIT) and visit a bank to make \\npayments at each stage. The aim would be to allow this  process to be followed through a single visit to a single \\ngovernment portal facilitated by an OSSC. OSSC s would  provide both informational and transactional services  for up to \\n \\n24 URT PO -PSMGG (United Republic of Tanzania President’s Office - Public Service Management and Good Governance ). 2020.

The feasibility study also proposes us ing a processing fee (less than 5 \\npercent of the cost of a given service) as a means of financing OSSC s. While these services could also be accessed from \\na website, OSSC s would provide intermediary service s, such as  assist ing citizens in navigating the releva nt steps, \\naccept ing payments , printing and additional services.  Measures would be put in place to maximize the protection of \\nprivate data entered, uploaded , and processed at the OSSCs , as well as to shield  their servers from hacks, breaches , or \\naccidental exposure.  \\n \\n42. The project will work with existing government buildings and any civil works conducted will be subject to W B \\nenvironmental and social safeguards  procedures . In line with the draft budget presented in the feasibility study, the \\nactivities to be funded under this activity will include consultant fees, in particular for business process improvement , as \\nwell as supply of ICT goods and services and rehabilitation of the existing buildings (for instance, internal wiring and \\nrepartitionin g of rooms). Training of OSSC  staff will also be required, notably for cybersecurity awareness and good \\npractice. Supervision of the OSSC will involve (i) reviewing the designs for integrating service delivery platforms; (ii) \\nbuilding staff capacity; (iii) revising the OSSC’s legal frameworks; (iv) carrying out public awareness campaigns; (v) \\nrehabilitating/refurbishing existing infrastructure; (vi) providing/constructing last mile connectivity and interconnection \\nwith backend systems of serv ice delivery; (vii) providing ICT equipment; (viii) developing/establishing procedures and \\nprocesses for OSSC operations; and (ix) undertaking supervision, monitoring and evaluation of OSSCs’ performance.  One \\nof the aims of the OSSC program is to make gove rnment online services more accessible, and to this end, workshops will \\nbe held with targeted groups (such as women, the elderly, persons with disabilities) to understand their needs and \\naccessibility constraints in order to improve the user -friendliness  of the OSSCs . \\n \\nb) Digital Economy (US$ 8.0 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n43. This activity, under the MCIT  will focus on enhancement of GoT financial/payment systems by strengthening \\nregulations pertaining to digital financial transactions, in collaboration with the Bank of Tanzania (BoT), and enhancing \\nthe National Payment System (NPS). Regulations, standards , and guidelines on recognized international practices for the \\nprotection of digital payments systems and digital financial services from cybercrime will be adopted, as will measures \\nto protect the privacy of personal data in compliance with forthcoming leg islation. By establishing skills and systems that \\nbetter serve the digital economy, this activity should contribute to increasing revenue for the government. Financing \\nunder t he activity will support consultant services and purchase of ICT goods and servic es, including software \\ndevelopment and cybersecurity strengthening .  \\n \\n3.2  Data Center Infrastructure (US$1 3.2 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n44. This sub-component  aims to enhance the National Internet Data Centre (NIDC) i nfrastructure by acquiring \\nadditional storage and networking equipment (goods) and computing resources (services) for the government shared \\nplatform. It also seeks to enable cost -effective sharing of resources, increasing the reliability of electronic serv ices \\noffered by the GoT and enhancing the storage of government data as well as creating efficiency in sharing and accessing \\ngovernment applications through shared cloud infrastructure. For highly sensitive government data and confidential \\nprivate data, lo cal data storage hosting on a government cloud may be required , rather than using private cloud services . \\nFor this purpose, an existing government data center and the NIDC will be used and enhanced with additional security \\nand data storage capacity.  The cybersecurity and physical security of the NIDC  and its infrastructure will be assessed at \\nthe start of project implementation and via regular risk analyses and penetration tests throughout the lifetime of the \\nproject, with the recommendation s from this assessment to address vulnerabilities of the facilities  and to build the \\ncapacity of data center staff . Cybersecurity technical assistance (TA) will also be financed under  this sub -component , in \\ncomplement  to the cybersecurity training planned under sub-component 3.3b. Sub-component 3.2. will support   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 20 \\n \\nconsultant services  (for training and TA), purchase of ICT goods and services , and additional training, notably on \\ncybersecurity awareness, with a focus on good p ractice s in energy efficiency and use of renewable energy.  \\n \\n3.3  Digital Literacy and Capacity  Building (US$ 5.1 million  equivalent ) \\n \\na) Government ICT cadre training program (US$ 4.6 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n45. This activity seeks to build the capacity of ICT professionals with in the GoT for managing and supporting existing \\nand future government ICT systems (supply side) , based on an ICT skills gap assessment conducted in all ministries in \\n2018. The project foresees training in specialized ICT skills for up to 500 ICT experts from GoT ministries , with a balance \\nbetween men and women,  and longer courses (master’s degrees) at top -level universities  worldwide , as well as \\nrecognized industry certifications, for instance for cybersecurity, so that government IT officials can serve as Chief \\nInformation Security Officers (CSIOs) of their agencies . Synergies will be sought with the National Center for ICT \\nProfession al Development and Innovation supported under sub-component 1.1 to make sure the appropriate programs \\nare developed to support ICT professionals in the public sector or with interest in government jobs. Civil servants \\nbenefitting from training overseas w ill be required to have worked already for the government for several years and to \\nsign contracts to stay within government for a minimum length of time, or to commit to repaying part of the costs of the \\ntraining. The selection framework will be prepared and  included in the Project Implementation Manual ( PIM). This is \\nintended to reduce the level of brain drain from  the GoT. Training for e -service operation s will also be provided under  \\nthis sub-component .  \\n \\nb) Citizen Digital Literacy (US$0.5  million  equivalent ) \\n \\n46. This activity  will support  an awareness program that is intended to raise the level of utilization of online \\ngovernment services  and that will run for the entire  duration of the DTP. It will include, but not be limited to, social \\nmedia, TV , and radio programming to promote e -Government services; TV adverts and short video clips; print media \\ncampaign; dissemination of publicity materials; and workshops and seminars (for media  and the public). The awareness \\nprogram will include campaigns direc ted to the public to sensitize it to  cybersecurity and the protection of personal data \\nas well as the rights of individuals to determine use of their personal data . The program  will also resort to  digital forums, \\nconferences, exhibitions , and different dig ital competitions among youth to strengthen digital involvement and \\ncontribution in innovations and creativity.  The activity intends to increase digital literacy in terms of increased awareness \\nand usage of digital services by citizens, including specific consultations with the GoT and local stakeholders to ensure \\nthat women’s engagement with citizen services are accounted for . This activity will primarily support workshops, \\nconsultant services , and training.   \\n \\nComponent 4: Project Management (US$ 3.5 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n47. This component will support essential project management functions, covering primarily staff and operational \\ncosts. The Go T, through the MCIT and PO -PSMGG, will establish a single project implementation unit (PIU) , which will \\nbe responsible for supervising project implementation . The PIU will comprise an overall project coordinator, a digital \\ngovernment services specialist, an ICT technical specialist/ TA officer , and specialists in procurement and financial \\nmanagement  (FM)  as well as safeguards specialists. Component 4  will also include funding for strategic communications, \\nmonitoring and evaluation  (M&E) , internal audit, logistics and operational overhead, and specialists in gender inclusion , \\nand diversity. In addition, it will finance  capacity building for beneficiary agencies, such as the UCSAF and eGA, on the \\npreparation of bidding documents and contracts  specific to procurement of ICT, which often includes both goods and \\nservices in a sing le contract. The detailed list of PIU support activities  is defined in the PIM which has been developed  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 21 \\n \\nfor th e project.   \\n \\nUnallocated (US$ 7.5m  equivalent ) \\n \\n48. The project includes unallocated contingency fund ing that will be used to strengthen those project activities that \\nare disbursing well and where additional funds may be required. Eligible situations, scope and modalities of usage of the \\nunallocated fund will be defined in the PIM, but these reserved funds  must be used for the purposes of the PDO and  \\ncannot be used for any activities  other than those defined in this PAD  and in the financing agreement .  \\n \\nTable 1:  Summary of main project activities, by component  \\nNo. Component/Sub -component  Amount (US$, millions)  \\n1.

The project is intended to benefit all Tanzanians, covering the government, businesses , and citizens, through \\nimprovement in the affordability, availability , and quality of service delivery. However, more specific beneficiaries \\ninclude the rural population, through the proposed expansion of the rural network ( sub-component 2.2), government \\nagencies that will benefit from improved provision of connectivity to support service delivery ( sub-component 2.1), as \\nwell as citizens who will have more accessible e -services ( sub-component 3.1). Youth , as well as government employees \\nand citizens in gene ral, will benefit from improved digital skills and literacy (under component 1 and sub-component \\n3.3b). Women will be specifically targeted by the activities that seek to increase their participation in the digital economy \\nand digital skills development ( sub-component 3.3). The private sector will benefit both from the expanded training \\nopportunities under component 1 and the competitive bidding opportunities created under component 2 for the \\nprovision of internet and mobile broadband services .  \\n \\nD. Results  Chain  \\n50. The key elements of the Results Chain that will ensure  achievement of the PDO are: ( a) strengthening  the digital \\necosystem, (b) increasing  digital connectivity for governments and rural users, and (c) improving digital platforms and \\nservices. Figure 1 represents the results chain of the project and contributions to the PDO . The results chain assumes a \\nhigher degree of coordi nation  of governm ent ICT functions than is currently the case, for instance in the purchase of \\ninternet capacity and the adoption of cybersecurity principles. It also assumes effective private sector consultation \\nprocesses. Achievements in the se three areas will result in increase d access to affordable high -quality internet services \\nand improvement in the GoT’s provision of public services. The implementation of the DTP will also benefit all parts of \\nthe WB portfolio in Tanzania (see annex 2, table 10).   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 22 \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.Results Chain  \\n \\n \\nE. Rationale for Bank Involvement and Role of Partners  \\n51. The DTP capitalizes on digital technologies to accelerate growth, improve access to services, and make \\ngovernment operations more efficient. It supports a four -pronged approach to driving Tanzania\\'s digital transformation: \\n(a) the building  on the earlier RCIP -TZ program  and scaling up specific activities  that were initiated under RCIP -TZ, such \\nas on rural broadband ( sub-component 2.2) ; (b) adoption of technology solutions in all sectoral interventions; ( c) \\ndeepening integration and enhancin g the competitiveness of the regional telecom market and digital economy ; and (d) \\neffective coordination with activities in the sector conducted by other development partners, such as  the UPU \\nEcom@Africa Initiative  (in sub-component 1.2), the AfDB, the European Union, the Government of Finland and the \\nAgence Fran çaise de Développement  (AFD) .  \\n \\n52. Alignment with the WB’s Regional Integration Agenda  and planned program . Moreover, the DTP supports \\nregional goals to address market fragmentation in the financial sector and ICT/telecom investments in cross -border data \\nflows .). The DTP builds on the RCIP TZ by improving the regulatory environment and creating demand for regional digital \\ncontent . It supports enhancing transport, energy , and digital connectivity for improved services to rural areas. Physical \\nlinks to urban areas are critical to expand economic opportunities for Tanzanians in rural areas. There is also an \\nopportunity for Tanzania t o join the pipeline East and Southern Africa Regional Digital Integration Project (P176181 ) at \\na later stage.   \\n \\n53. The DTP will help identify and implement automated processes that reduce transaction costs both internally \\nand in the public sector’s interface with citizens and businesses ; automation will also minimize the scope for discretion \\n The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 23 \\n \\nfor public officials and enhance s ervice delivery mechanisms. Technology -based service enhancements will complement \\nthe OSSCs  (sub-component  3.1). The DTP  will support this transition to more automated services and establish electronic \\npayments, for example , taxes, licensing fees, and fine s. More intensive use of ICT in data collection and publication will \\nhelp the government increase frequency and accessibility of statistical data in the country. Finally, the project will also \\nsupport the WBG’s twin goals, in particular the activities unde r sub-component 2.2  that will extend coverage of mobile \\nbroadband to rural areas , which will help in alleviating poverty . Activities that will  strengthen digital SMEs under \\ncomponent  1 will contribute to shared prosperity.   \\nF. Lessons Learned and Reflected in the Project Design  \\n \\n54. The Digital Tanzania Project ’s design, preparation , and implementation arrangements draw  from lessons \\nlearned during the RCIP -TZ implementation.  For example, the RCIP -TZ demonstrated the positive impact of using a \\nphased approach to enable smoother implementation and strengthen the project’s relevance throughout its course. The \\nidentification of this sequencing at the preparation stage can result in a more efficien tly organized implementation \\nprocess. Additionally, a trade -off exists between time needed for proper implementation and the relevance of activities \\ndesigned. This is particularly relevant in the ICT sector where technology and priorities evolve very fast.  A multi -phased \\napproach allows for more flexibility in adapting the project’s design to changing circumstances in the ICT sector or in the \\ncountry context to ensure the project’s relevance throughout its life. The project design will also seek synergies b etween \\ndifferent infrastructure sectors (for instance, energy and transport, as well as to enhance the digital  economy ) to \\npromote ‘dig once ’ policies for infrastructure deployment. The fact that the MCIT was formerly part of the Ministry of \\nWorks, Transport and Communications  (MWTC ), which had responsibility for works and transport as well as digital \\ncommunications , will be an advantage in this respect.   \\n \\n55. Coordination.  For successful implementation of ICT sector reforms, projects within a country must be fully aligned \\nwith governments’ priorities, timeline, and institutional capacity, as well as other ongoing initiatives in the country. An \\nintegrated approach is always best. In the case of Tanzania, the achievement of project objectives and the realization of \\nsome of the activities depended directly on results pursued by the Go T outside the scope of the RCIP -TZ. The project \\nprovided direct support to the proper deploymen t and operationalization of the NICTBB  in the country , even if this was \\nnot explicitly part of the project scope , as the team recognized the NICTBB as a key element to the achievement of the \\nRCIP -TZ’s objectives and the realization of activities under the connectivity component. Establishing more  formal \\nmechanisms for collaboration with other development partners active in the sector  will help the implementation of the \\nproject, especially for component 3.   \\n \\n56. Digital government.  Through the DTP, t he GoT and the WB will be  focusing their investments in building the \\nfoundations of digital government (interoperability modules and Application Programming Interfaces [APIs ], cloud \\ntechnology, cybersecurity, data warehouses, and so on ), instead of developing specific eGovernment applications. \\neGovernment applications might become obsolete during the lifetime of the project, especially if the implementation \\nperiod is significa ntly extended. Additionally, developing eGovernment applications requires strong coordination \\nbetween different parts of government, thereby significantly mitigating coordination risks that the project might incur \\nduring implementation.   \\n \\n57. Public Private Pa rtner ship models.  The RCIP -TZ project  proved the importance of simple Public Private \\nPartnership ( PPP) arrangements and provided examples of different but equally effective PPP models. In Malawi and \\nMozambique, the pre -purchase of wholesale bandwidth by the government created incentives and reduced investment \\nrisk for private operators to build out new bac kbone infrastructure which could serve both the government and the \\nprivate market. This significantly reduced the investment costs for the government and eliminated ongoing maintenance  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 24 \\n \\nand operations risks and liabilities. It also created many of the same benefits of alternative PPP models such as \\nconsortiums or management contracts whereby the government retains some level of shareholding/ownership of the \\nnetwork while avoiding complex legal arrangements for joint ownership (which can lead to delays i n operationalization , \\nfinancial and operational risks, and financial liabilities for maintenance and upgrades). In Tanzania, the reverse subsidy \\nauction model adopted for rural mobile connectivity ensured highest value for money and maximum leveraging of \\nprivate financing through the competitive award process while shifting all financial and operational risk for the mobile \\nsites and service offerings to the private sector operators. Government equity or partial/full ownership of the mobile \\nsites would have created a more complicated legal and operational structure as well as greater risk. The positive \\noutcomes from the RCIP -TZ suggest that these models are both effective in delivering results and efficient in their cost \\nstructure and organization and could b e adopted in future connectivity operations leveraging the MFD principle.   \\n \\nIII. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS  \\n \\nA. Institutional and Implementation Arrangements  \\n58. The primary agencies involved in the implementation of the project are the MCIT and the PO -PSMGG. The MCIT \\nwill be the overall lead implementing ministry , hosting the project implementation unit (PIU) , while the PO-PSMGG will \\ncoordinate the implementation of e -Government -related components (notably sub-components 2.1 and 3.2) and \\nparticipate in other activities under the project , such as OSSCs  (sub-component 3.1). The project’s proposed institutional \\nand implementation arrangements will benefit from the experience and lessons drawn  from the successful \\nimplementation of the RCIP -TZ. The latter’s PIU, which was reporting to both the MCIT and PO -PSMGG, had performed \\nsatisfactorily until the project  closed on December 31, 2017, though th e dual reporting structure caused some delays in \\ngaining internal clearances for procurements.  For the DTP, a single PIU will be created, within MCIT . In addition, the \\nMCIT already has a lot of experience in working with the WB, as it implemented several other WB-funded projects in \\nearlier years , notably in the transport sector, when it was part of the former MWTC.  \\n \\n59. Drawing on the lessons learned from the RCIP -TZ, a number of changes are proposed to the PIU structure and \\nprocedure s to improve efficiency and reduce implementation risk.  These include :  \\n \\ni. Designation of a single, fully dedicated project coordinator for all project activities (previously this was split \\nbetween different representatives for each institution, and the positions were shared with other government \\nresponsibilities). Technical oversight would remain with the relevant stakeholder for each component/activity, \\nwhile the project coordinator would have responsibility and authority for day -to-day project management, \\ncoordination between the PIU and relevant technical counterpart, oversight of procurement, FM, safeguards, \\nproject communications, and so on . Table 9 in annex 2 provides information on the allocation of responsibilities \\nfor technical oversight for different activities. In general terms, the MCIT is responsible for all of component 1 , \\npartnering with the TCRA for  sub-component 1.2a and the TPC for sub-component 1.2c, and is itself a partner \\nin all other sub -components. The MCIT is also responsible for some parts of  sub-component 3.1 . PO-PSMGG is \\nresponsible for sub-component 2 .1, parts of 3.1,  and for sub-component s 3.2 and 3.3 . The UCSAF is responsible \\nfor sub-component 2.2. PIU staff for FM, procurement, safeguards, communications, and so on  would likewise \\ncover all project activities .  \\n \\nii. A single designated account  (DA)  is proposed and will be under the dedicated PIU  in MCIT . Permanent \\nSecretar ies (PSs) from both ministries ( the MCIT and PO -PSMGG ) will have decision -making responsibility for \\nthe approval of activities that will be under their respective institutions .  \\n \\niii. Recruitment of at least one (1) environmental and one (1) dedicated social specialist to strengthen oversight of  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 25 \\n \\nsafeguards issues ; and  \\n \\niv. Strengthening of the PIU with on -call staff who are familiar with WB procedures  for communications, M &E, and \\ndiversity inclusion management, given the larger project size and number of activities proposed under DTP.    \\n \\n60.  Beyond the MCIT and PO -PSMGG, key project stakeholders will be involved in project design and oversight via \\na Project Steering Committee (PSC). The PSC  will provide g uidance on priority setting and cross -MDA coordination \\nthroughout the lifecycle of the project.  It wi ll also be responsible for monitoring and ensuring that the project is \\nsuccessfully implemented through designated implementation arrangement s. The PSC will be chaired by the PS of MCIT, \\nwith the PS -PO-PSMGG acting as vice -chair . Its members will include, but not be limited to, the PS -PO-RALG, PS -PO-\\nMSMGG and PS -MoEST. CEOs of other stakeholder s and beneficiaries may be invited to attend as required.  \\n \\n61. A Technical Committee (TC) reporting to the PSC and gathering different beneficiary institutions w ill advise and \\nmake recommendations on specific technical aspects of project implementation, as required by the PSC . The TC will  \\nreport to the PSC and be chaired by the Director of ICT within the MCIT. The permanent members of the TC will include, \\nbut not be limited to, representatives from MCIT, MoFP, PO -RALG, PO -PSMGG, MoEST  and UCSAF . A large number of \\nother MDAs, notably the Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elders and Children, COSTECH, TCRA \\nand the MIT, figure amongst the list of project beneficiaries that will have an opportunity, together with representatives \\nfrom the private sector, academia and other stakeholders, to participate in the TC on request, for consultations, as \\nrequired , according to the agenda items . Terms of refere nce (ToR) for both the PSC and TC have been prepared and form \\npart of the PIM.  \\n \\n62. Data Protection . Large volumes of personal data, personally identifiable information and sensitive data are likely \\nto be collected and used in connection with the management o f this project , under circumstances where measures to \\nensure the legitimate, appropriate and proportionate use and processing of that data do not yet feature in national \\nlaw25. To guard against potential abuse of that data, the project will incorporate best international practices for dealing \\nwith data in these partic ular circumstances.  Such measures may include, for example, (a) data minimization (collecting \\nonly data that are necessary for the purpose); (b) data accuracy (correcting or erasing data that are not necessary or are \\ninaccurate);  (c) use limitations ( data are only used for legitimate and related purposes); (d) data retention (retain data \\nonly for as long as they are ne cessary); (e) informing data subjects of use and processing of data and allowing data \\nsubjects the opportunity to correct information about them, and so on .  \\n \\n63. Private Capital Mobilization  (PCM) . The project is designed around the principle of MFD , whereby the private \\nsector takes the lead in investment and service provision wherever possible and public funds are only used in the event \\nof market failure. As a result , it is expected that IDA f inancing  will serve to mobilize private capital in a numb er of ways:  \\n \\na) The primary  PCM  mechanism used in the project is reverse auctions  (under  sub-component 2.1 on rural \\nbroadband ). Under the RCIP -TZ, the reverse auction mechanism leveraged private investment in the ratio  of \\njust over  1:2 – that is , US$30m of IDA f inancing  subsid ies leveraged around US$70m in investment in cell \\ntowers from private mobile operators. Under this project, t his ratio is expected to be lower, as the zones \\ntargeted are more economically marginal, but still significant. However, as this is an outcome of a competitive \\nbidding process, the exact anticipated  value of PCM has not been reported  to avoid signaling to the private \\nsector the level at whi ch they should bid.  \\n \\nb) PCM is also likely through the pre-purchase  of internet capacity  for MDAs  under sub-component 2.1. Here, \\n \\n25 New draft legislation  covering  data protection is under development in Tanzania, but as of March 2021, it had not yet passed into law.   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 26 \\n \\nthe GoT  is acting as an anchor tenant in guaranteeing an income for investors that commit  funds to building \\nout their network in urban  and rural areas. Again,  the incremental additional investment t o which the project \\nwill contribute  is difficult to estimate , as it will be the outcome of a competitive bidding process, but it is \\nlikely to be substantial as the project is committing US$ 33m of IDA f inancing  to the sub-component.  \\n \\nc) PCM could also arise  under  sub-component 1.1, where the funding of the so ft-centers and FabLabs are likely \\nto stimulate investment from th ose private companies whose growth is nurtured through these initiatives. \\nPrivate capital may also be invested alongside public funds in the planned National Center for ICT Professional \\nDevelo pment  and Innovation. Finally, public investment in a national addressing and postcode system under \\nsub-component 1.2 should stimulate private sector investment in eCommerce.  \\n \\nB. Results Monitoring and Evaluation  Arrangements  \\n64. A national ICT data collection survey has been undertaken in preparation of the project. This baseline survey, \\nfinanced through the Digital Development Platform and using the Survey of Well -being via Instant and Frequent Tracking \\n(SWIFT ) methodology, was c arried out by the WB in 2018 -19. Subsequent surveys are expected to be carried out every \\ntwo to three  years ( that is , twice during the life of the project and once following completion), covering over 1,400 \\nhouseholds in rural and urban locations and inclu ding Zanzibar. The SWIFT data diagnostic  focused on key indicators \\nrelated to ICT adoption, usage , and impact and was disaggregated by income group, gender, type of mobile \\nphone/service , and so on . Areas targeted as part of the rural connectivity program will receive specific attention to help \\ninform project design and course corrections. In addition, a Digital Sources of Growth  study was commissioned by the \\nWB in 2019 and formed the basis for a special focus chapter on the development of the Digital Economy in Tanzania in \\nthe 14th edition of the Tanzania Economic Update  (May 2020). The National ICT Sta tistical Management Information \\nSystem that will be developed under sub-component 1.2b  should  allow for improved monitoring of key performance \\nindicators  (KPIs)  in the sector.   \\n \\n65. The project will also leverage the W B Geo-Enabling Initiative  for Monitoring and Supervision (GEMS) for data \\ncollection and analysis, including citizen engagement . GEMS uses open source tools for in -field collection of structured \\ndigital data that automatically feeds into a centralized M&E system. Using GEMS systema tically allows operations to \\nenhance the transparency and accuracy of M&E, and the accountability of third -party monitoring.  \\n \\nC. Sustainability  \\n66. The project’s sustainability should be ensured using private  sector led, market -based mechanisms for allocation \\nof resources. As an example, the provision of internet access to government MDAs under sub-component 2.1 will be \\nallocated through a competitive bidding mechanism that awards long -term supply (or IRU) for internet capacity (typically \\nfor 10 –15 years , that is , beyond the closing date of the project) to winning bidders. Similarly, the provision of rural \\nbroadband under sub-component 2.2 is assured through the use of the ‘reverse auction ’ mechanism, whereby a subsidy \\nis offered to the network operator or tower company seeking the lowest level of subsidy to construct and run the \\ninfrastructure under a competitive bidding process. In coordination with the PIU, t he funding flow to the UCSAF , the \\nuniversal service agency which collects a small percentage of operator revenue, will guarantee the sustainability of the \\nrural broadband component . It may in the future also be used to support connectivity for schools and hospitals and \\ngeneral broadband development (under sub-component 2.1). The phased structure of the project should help reinforce \\nits longer -term sustainability, with lessons learned in earlier phases applied in project design for later phases. For \\ninstance, several of the project components that wil l be procured in multiple lots ( for example , sub-components 2.1 and \\n2.2) or in multiple unit s (for example , the OSSCs in sub-component 3.1 and the soft  centers in sub-component 1.1) can \\nbe phased to allow for learnings to be applied in later procurements  (learning by doing) .  \\n  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 27 \\n \\n \\nIV. PROJECT APPRAISAL SUMMARY  \\n \\nA. Technical, Economic and Financial Analysis  \\n67. The anticipated economic and financial benefits of the DT P come from three main sources:   \\n \\na) Improvements in connectivity and coverage of digital technologies , in particular from rural mobile \\nbroadband, largely from component 2, sustained by regulatory enhancements foreseen in sub-component \\n1.1c. Direct impacts will accrue from a growing ICT sector ,26 particularly the spillover into computer and \\ninformation services as applications and data storage and processing facilities are developed to leverage the \\nincreased connectivity. Indirect benefits accrue from increased connectivity across different economic sectors. \\nEnterprise productivity is enhanced, thereby boosting growth. Analysis presented in annex 3 suggests that the \\nnet present value  (NPV)  generated by the boost to GDP would be worth about  US$47.7  million  over the period \\ntill 2028, with further gains thereafter. The enhanced connectivity for government institutions and district \\nhealth centers will also benefit the government’s provision of digital services and response to emergencies \\nsuch as the COVID -19 pandemic and other outbreaks . \\n \\nb) The impact of enhanced electronic public services , which is foreseen in component 3. In the economic analysis \\ncarried out to support this program, the model of Sri Lanka has been followed as a case study. There, the gains \\nper household from the eLanka development program (P081771; US$53  million ) were worth around US$6.12 \\nper household per year, often from time savings. Applying this to Tanzania would generate an expected saving \\nworth around  US$190  million  over 10 years . \\n \\nc) Finally,  the cost savings  for government institutions, which also derive mainly from component 3, can be \\ncalculated in a similar manner. Based on Australian experience, there is an estimated saving of over US$12 per \\ntransaction from doing transactions online that would otherwise r equire face -to-face interaction. If just \\n50 percent of government transactions with businesses and citizens could be transferred online, the net saving \\nwould be US$867  million  over 10 years , or around 5 percent of the national government budget. This is \\ntherefore the biggest potential saving of all,  though the main benefits would only be observed in the long term  \\nonce the connectivity agenda has been addressed and the focus can shift to developing  eServices and  \\neTransactions.  \\n \\n68. These estimates as well as other economic and financial benefits from the  DTP are explored in more detail in \\nannex 3. They indicate that the modest investment in the DT P (US$150  million ) would be repaid many times over from \\npotential cost savings and from the boost to economic growth  of over US$1.1 b illion over 10 years, or around  \\nUS$433 million  using NPV . Furthermore, this calculation does not take into account savings and economic boost from \\nother part s of the program, such as the stimulus to e -Commerce (in sub-component 1.2) or the benefits from better \\ntrained c ivil servants (under sub-component 3.3).  Overall, therefore, DTP will provide a welcome boost to Tanzania’s \\nfuture economic prospects.  \\n \\n \\n26 The statistical classification of the ICT sector includes the following services: tele communications, computer programming; consultancy and \\nrelated activities; and d ata processing, hosting , and related activities; web portals .

The project components were designed as an integrated and interlinked program to maximize the development \\nimpact of the investments . Investment from the WB and development partners is being complemented by TA, reform , \\nand skills development support to increase access to both ICTs and digital services while also equipping citizens, \\nbusinesses, and the government with the skills, capacity, and incentives they need to use them to reap maximum \\ndividends. This approach alig ns with lessons learned from other operations and from the World Development Report  \\n2016  (WDR16) on Digital Dividends . The WDR16 analysis highlights the need to complement access to technology with \\nreforms and investment in ‘analog’ foundations. Thus, in t he DTP’s  design, sub-components 2.1 and 2.2 as well as sub-\\ncomponents 3.1 and 3.2 focus on the investment in digital technologies  and component 1 is intended to strengthen the \\nanalog foundations, in particular policy and regulation ( sub-component 1.1c), in stitutional capacity and accountability \\n(sub-component 1.1a) , and development of digital skills ( sub-components 1.1a , 1.1b , and 3.3).  \\n \\n70. The technical design is consistent with international best practices. The design of the project is founded on a \\nmodel of competitive private sector delivery wherever possible, utilizing a n MFD approach to leverage private sector \\nexpertise and financing and  to contribute to overall sector development. This is fully consistent with international \\nexperience and lessons learned from the RCIP -TZ program, which show that this is a more cost -effective and efficient \\nway of delivering ICT services rather than throug h direct government financing, ownership, and operation of telecom \\ninfrastructure. It is a ‘demand -side’ rather than a ‘supply -side’ intervention, applying principles of open access and \\nnondiscriminatory pricing. To borrow from the terminology of WDR16 ,27 the locus of the intervention is mainly at the \\nmiddle mile ( sub-component 2.1) and the last mile ( sub-components 2.2 and 3.2), backed up by strengthening of \\n‘invisible mile ’ elements of data protection and management of scarce resources , such as spectrum and rights  of way \\n(sub-component 1.1c).  \\n \\n71. Tried and tested digital technologies will be used through demand -side pre -purchase and demand aggregation \\nmethodologies . While the procurement processes will be technology  neutral, leaving technical choices to commercial \\nvendors, it is expected that the middle mile technology to be employed will be primarily fiber -optic cables, backed up \\nby microwave and satellite (as a tem porary solution) in the more remote and rural areas, where the need arises. In the \\nlast mile, fiber will also be used for government clients ( sub-component 2.1), but for small businesses and citizens in \\nrural areas mobile broadband solutions will be deploy ed under sub-component 2.2. In this context, mobile broadband \\nimplies 3G and 4G  mobile cellular technology, though there will be scope to experiment with private led fifth generation \\ntechnologies (5G) which are now becoming available, as well as emerging t echnologies for rural broadband such as \\nTVWS, high -altitude platform systems (HAPS) , and nanosats.   \\n \\n72. Technical choices will rely on climate -resilient design to the extent possible . As climate and geophysical hazards \\nmay affect digital infrastructure, future -proof technologies that are more resilient and robust than traditional ones will \\nbe prioritized. As noted, to the extent possible underground deployment of fiber cables, as oppos ed to , for example, \\naerial cables, will be prioritized, as these are water  resistant and tend to be more robust.  The overall design will  take \\ninto account recent climate change trends and future -projected changes.    \\n \\nB. Fiduciary  \\n \\n(i)    Financial Management  \\n \\n73. Adequate FM arrangements are in place and meet the minimum requirements for WB-supported  projects . The \\n \\n27 World Bank. 2016. World Development Report: Digital Dividends .  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 29 \\n \\nMCIT and the PO -PSMGG implemented the RCIP -TZ. The project would build on the lessons learned by the RCIP -TZ. A \\nsingle project DA denominated in U.S. dollars will be opened at the BoT into which the proceeds of the loan will flow \\nfrom the WB to the project. The GoT will establish a single PIU which would be responsible for the day -to-day operations \\nincluding the FM activities of the project. The MCIT and PO -PSMGG both will deploy qualified project accountants \\napproved by the WB to the PIU. The PS MCIT and the PS PO -PSMGG will both have independent oversight (approval) \\nauthority for the initiation, approval , and the authorization of pr oject expenses under the respective components for \\ntheir ministries and submit the approved expenditures directly to the PIU for payment processing  in line with the \\ngovernment’s regulations, including the Government D -Fund system, and the WB’s regulation s. The PIU  will be responsible \\nfor convening meetings including of the PSC and TCs. The PSC will be chaired by the PS of the MCIT with the PS of  PO-\\nPSMGG  as vice -chair . During the FM assessment s for the RCIP -TZ, the following key risks were identified: (a) the risk of \\nlack of coordination across the implementing MDAs (MCIT and PO -PSMGG) leading to delayed disbursement ; (b) \\nmultiple DAs and the disbursement issues; (c) the risk of loan proceeds not being used for the purpose intended; and (d) \\nfinancial reporting and oversight and delayed audit reports. The mitigating measures for the DTP are as follows: (a) a \\nsingle PIU will be established to manage the day -to-day activities of the project; (b) the PSC will have ov erall oversight \\nresponsibility for the project, and only the activities approved  by the PSC will be implemented; (c) the project will be \\naudited by the Controller and Auditor General (CAG) of Tanzania; and (d) the PIU will submit the audited project financial \\nstatements  (PFS)  to the WB six months after the end of each financial year.  The fiduciary risk is considered substantial.  \\n \\n (ii)   Procurement  \\n \\n74. Procurement for the project will be carried out in accordance with the W B Procurement Regulations for IPF \\nBorrowers under Investment Project Financing , dated November 202 0 (hereafter referred to as ‘Procurement \\nRegulations ’); Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by IBRD Loans and \\nIDA Credits and Grants (revised July 1, 2016); and the provisions stipulated in the financing agreement.  \\n \\n75. As required by the Procurement Regulations , a Project Procurement Strategy for Development (PPSD) has been \\ndeveloped  by the Implementing Agency and approved by the WB . Based on the PPSD a Procurement Plan (PP) covering \\nactivities for at least the first 18 months has been prepared which will be finalized with PPSD. The procurement plan set s \\nout the selection methods to be followed by the Recipient in t he procurement of goods, works, non -consulting services, \\nand consulting services financed by the WB. The PP will be updated at least every 12 months, or as required, to reflect \\nthe actual project implementation needs. Each update of the PP shall require W B approval. All PPs will be publicly \\ndisclosed in accordance with the W B disclosure policy.   \\n \\n76. The MCIT and PO -PSMGG will use Systematic Tracking of Exchanges in Procurement (STEP), a WB system to \\nprepare, clear , and update PPs and conduct all procurement transactions. Personnel from the MCIT and PO -PSMGG will \\nbe trained in STEP, as necessary, by WB sta ff.  \\n \\n77. A procurement capacity and risk assessment has been carried out by the WB for the MCIT and PO -PSMGG  to \\nreview the organizational structure for implementing the project and the adequacy of procurement staff. Based on the \\nassessment and taking note of the role and responsibility of the MCIT and PO -PSMGG for procurement, the procurement \\nrisk rating was rat ed as Substantial. Details of the risk assessment and mitigation measures are provided in annex 1 .  \\n \\n \\n  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 30 \\n \\nC.

Environmental and Social Standards  \\n \\n(i) Environmental standards  \\n78. The DTP will support subprojects and activities that are likely to generate some unfavorable and site -specific \\nenvironmental and social impacts.  However, the exact nature of subprojects, their location, and core areas of impacts, \\nextent, magnitude, and duration of impacts caused by the various types of investments are yet to be specified to a \\ndetailed level where an Environmental and Socia l Impact Assessment (ESIA) and or an Environmental and Social \\nManagement Plan (ESMP) can be developed for approval under the national regulations. The WB Environmental and \\nSocial Framework ( ESF) institute s a requirement for appraisal before the  approval of  funding. The W B Environmental \\nand Social Standards  (ESS)  relevant for the DTP are the ESS 1  - Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social \\nRisks and Impacts; ESS 2  - Labor and Working Conditions ; ESS 3  - Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention and \\nManagement ; ESS 4 - Community Health and Safety ; ESS 5 - Land Acquisition, Restrictions on Land Use and Involuntary \\nResettlement ; ESS 6  - Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources ; ESS 7  - \\nIndigenous Peoples/Sub -Saharan African Historically Underserved Traditional Local Communities ; ESS 8 - cultural \\nheritage;  and ESS 10  - Stakeholder Engagement & Information Disclosure.   \\n \\n79. Given that the DTP will be implemented nationwide , and that the exact locations of physical interventions are \\nnot precisely known at this stage, a n Environmental and Social Management Framework ( ESMF ) has been prepared to \\nreflect ESF requirements. Once the network’s details and specific locations for the construction of associated \\ninfrastructures have become known, site -specific ESMPs will be prepared as necessary during project implementation, \\nin line wit h the ESMF. The private sector, wherever involved, will be required to use the ESMF to guide its own policy on \\nenvironmental management and thereby conform to national policies and W B’s ESF.  \\n \\n80. ESS 1: Assessment and Management of Environmental and Social Risks and Impacts  applies under the proposed \\nactivities under Component s 1, 2, 3, and 5. The impacts likely to be generated will be site specific and range from low to \\nmoderate in significance and can be easily mitigated. Potential impacts and risks are expected to be site specific and \\nlargely during construction stage of the works and as well as during the implementation of other soft components of the \\nproject such as trainings. The risks and impacts include: ( a) exposure or propagation of communicable diseases during \\nthe implementation of activities, both in terms of community exposure and exposure of project workers; ( b) dust and \\nnoise pollution; ( c) restrictions with regard to  access and traffic disruption; ( d) road safe ty hazards and increase in traffic \\nand its related accidents during construction ; (e) loss of vegetation which might lead to alteration of habitats;  (f) \\ncommunity and occupational health and safety hazards largely during the construction stage of the subprojects; ( g) land \\nacquisition and/or economic displacement; ( h) safety of workers, neighboring communities , and road users resulting \\nfrom increase in traffic around and toward construction sites; (i ) generation of waste (including construction and e -\\nwaste); (j) both positive and negative impacts to Vulnerable Groups in case project activities are implemented in their \\ncommunities; ( k) electric and magnetic fields; ( l) occupational risks due to likely exposure of workers to microscopic glass \\nfiber shards/ glasses that can penetrate human skin  and eye and can be inhaled and associated hazards like fire risks due  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 31 \\n \\nto presence of flammable materials in high -powered laser installation areas ; (m) occupational hazards to workers from \\ncontact with live power lines during construction, maintenance, and operation activities ; (n) economic growth and \\nlivelihoods diversification from increased and secured e -economy; (o) risks of gender -based violence/ sexual exploitation \\nand abuse - sexual harassment (GBV/SEA -SH); and (p) expanded rural and urban connectivity to ICT and access to \\nservices.    \\n \\n81. Based on th e preliminary assessment, the project has prepared: ( a) an ESMF which cover s all risks and impacts \\nassociated with ESS  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 during construction and operation ; this will guide the preparation of site -\\nspecific ESMP s for subprojects during implementation of the project but before  commencement of civil works ; (b) a \\nResettlement Policy Framework (RPF) to guide the development of site -specific RAPs which will be prepared during \\nproject implementation; (c) a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP); and ( d) an Environmental and Social Commitment \\nPlan (ESCP) that has been agreed upon with the borrower and has set out the substantive measures and actions that will \\nbe required for the project to meet environmental and social requirements over a specified period of time. The project \\nwill also prepare and disclose after Board approval but before  project effectivene ss: (a) Labor Management Procedures; \\nand (b) a Vulnerable Groups Planning Framework (VGPF) to lay out the steps to be followed to promote sustainable \\ndevelopment benefits and opportunities in a manner that is accessible, culturally appropriate/inclusive fo r the \\nsubprojects implemented in interest areas  for vulnerable groups . \\n \\n82. ESS 3 Resource Efficiency and Pollution Prevention and Management.  Implementation of activities to be financed \\nunder project sub -components may generate dust, erosion, sediments, solid and liquid wastes including oils, which are \\nlikely to pollute water bodies and the air and land if not properly managed. Screening will de termine the significance of \\nthe likely impacts and risks and mitigation measures will be included in the sub project ESMPs. Mitigation measures will \\nbe adopted for both construction purpose and in any construction camp to ensure surface/ground water use ef ficiency. \\nAppropriate measure will be observed to manage solid and liquid waste from the construction site and camps.  \\n \\n83. ESS 4 on Community Health and Safety. The implementation of some of the project components will involve civil \\nand structural works that m ay pose risks to the community during construction and operations. The project will further \\nevaluate the risks and impacts of investments that have not been identified at this stage but could have on the health \\nand safety o f the local communities during co nstruction and operation stages and propose and implement appropriate \\nmitigation measures.  \\n \\n84. The ESMPs will form a part of bidding and contractual documents for the implementation of the subprojects. \\nThe contracted service providers and/or construction contractors will prepare site -specific Contractor  Environmental, \\nSocial, Health and Safety Management Plans based on the project -developed , and site-specific ESMPs.  \\n \\n85. The design of the project facilities and their construction will also ensure safety for workers and communities.  \\nThe project will take into consideration: ( a) views of the communities sourced through the consultations as guided by \\nthe SEP and ( b) screening of the subprojects and development of site-specific ESMP s. The ESMP(s) will also include \\nEmergency Response Plans according to ESS  4 that will be mandatory for the construction period and recommended for \\nthe operation stage. Contents and scope for the plans according to the different identified risks are described in the \\nESMF.  \\n \\n86. The project’s traffic - and construction -related impacts within or surrounding the project worksites could affect  \\npersons with disabilit ies more if adequate mitigation measures are not in place . The project will consult with and assess \\nrisks to persons with  disabilit ies within each community hosting the subprojects and include in the ESMPs commensurate \\nmigration measures. These may include but not be limited to necessary signage understandable to both community and  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 32 \\n \\nproject workforce; consultation and sensiti zation of persons with disabilities in the communities about the project, risks, \\nmitigation measures, and available grievance redress channels; awareness raising to community and project workers on \\nchallenges faced by, risk to persons with disability and p roject -prepared mitigation measures; and provision of universal \\naccess in all sites and project -funded facilities.  \\n \\n87. Hazardous materials  and general waste . Some potential risks are related to use of diesel, oil, batteries, electronic \\nwastes and general waste from camp sites as well as day to day construction activities (waste water, pallets, solid waste , \\nand so on ), the ESMF defines the measures to avoid, prevent and mitigate adverse impact on the health and safety of \\nworks, communities and ecosy stems. The project will include measures and actions to reduce risks during storage, \\ntransportation and final disposal of hazardous materials and general waste.  \\n \\n88. ESS 6 Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources . Given  that the actual \\nsites of some of the possible infrastructure development are still unknown , this standard is considered relevant at this \\npoint. Potential impacts to habitat may be more significant during modification/rehabilitation and ins tallation of \\ninfrastructure. Recommended measures to prevent and control impacts to terrestrial habitats during rehabilitation of \\nthe right -of-way include: Sit ing fixed line infrastructure ( for example,  fiber optic cable) and other types of linear \\ninfrastr ucture rights -of-way, access; roads, lines, and towers to avoid critical habitat s through use of existing utility and \\ntransport corridors, whenever possible; Avoidance of modification/rehabilitation of project activities during the \\nbreeding season and othe r sensitive seasons or times of day; Revegetation of disturbed areas with native plant species. \\nNecessary measures and requirements should be included in bids and contracts and any ESMP or C -ESMP . \\n \\n(ii) Social standards  \\n \\n89. DTP will be a critical enabler of socioeconomic development and transformation, especially in the rural areas \\nwhere there is a greater digital divide compared to the urban centers. The project will have an overall positive impact \\non the country’s population, both urban and rural, particularly on youth through capacity development initiatives and \\nincentives for job creation under components 1 and 2. In addition, it will increase efficacy of public service delivery and \\npromote more equitable and easier access to  services by citizens. The project has been designed to be gender and \\ndisability inclusive through  the following : (a) the design of the OSSCs will ensure accessibility for persons with disability, \\nas well as exploring the opportunity to tailor digital serv ices to the special needs of vulnerable groups; ( b) sub-\\ncomponent 3.3 will also address issues of web  accessibility for elderly and disabled citizens, including best practice on \\ninterface design and user  agents; ( c) component 1, in particular, will seek to increase women’s access to technology , and \\nwill undertake interventions to strengthen digital skills and foster digital entrepreneurship with  special emphasis on \\nwomen, for example , by increasing women ’s participation in programs of the National Center for ICT Professional \\nDevelopment and Innovation. Also, in sub-component 1.1, there will be a focus o n providing equivalent access to both \\nmen and women to digital skills training.  \\n \\n90. The W B’s due diligence found social risks and impacts that could resu lt from the implementation of the project . \\nComponent s 2 and 3 are expected to be implemented mainly within the existing wayleaves  and government -owned \\nfacilities and thus this will minimize the need for land acquisition but might require the clearing of encroachment on the \\nwayleaves. These may result in both physical and/or economic displacement. Other social impacts and risks may include \\nbut are not limited to: ( a) labor influx and associated GBV/SEA in the project area, whose risk has been rated as low as \\nper the GBV/SEA risk assessment; ( b) increase in local inflation; ( c) pressure on social amenities during construction of \\nsome of the facilities  requiring increase in non -local labor; ( d) possible increase in prevalence of human  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 33 \\n \\nimmunod eficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV/AID S); and ( e) exclusion of vulnerable groups28 \\nand/or vulnerable persons which include but are not limited  to women, the elderly , and persons with disabilities in the \\nconsultation process of subproject activities in sub-component 3.3 b, citizen digital literacy. These will be addressed by \\nthe: (i) RPF that will guide the preparation of site -specific R APs; (ii) E SIAs and their accompanying ESMPs and C -ESMPs; \\n(iii) Labor Management Plan ( LMP ); (iv) SEP ; and (v) Vulnerable Groups Plans (VGP) of the sub -projects prepared \\nfollowing the V GPF. \\n \\n91. ESS 4 on Commu nity Health and Safety. Some project sub -components (such as sub-component 2.2) may \\ngenerate labor influx and its related risks and impacts including GBV/SEA , as well as labor working conditions related \\nissues . The GBV risk assessment has been conducted and the risks were found to be Low. Skilled workforce may not be \\navailable in some of the rural areas and therefore construction -related  activities are likely t o involve both local and \\nnonlocal laborers. The project workforce is expected to be small. Other social impacts and risks that are not limited to \\nGBV/SEA are possible increase in the prevalence of HIV/AID S, crime and social conflict between local community  and \\nnon-local workers, pressure on social services and amenities, etc. . To manage the risks associated with labor influx and \\nits resultant impacts, provisions will be made in the Standard Bidding and Procurement Documents as well as in the site -\\nspecific contractors ESMPs for the subprojects. Very early in the project implement ation phase, this is expected  to \\nculminate in the development and adoption of but not limited to the following: GBV/SEA risk mitigation plans; guidance \\non labor force -host community relations; HIV/AID S prevention and management program; child labor and abu se \\nprevention policy and strategy; prevention of SEA policy and standard operating procedures; and grievance redress \\nmanagement system (separate for both community and project workforce). The project will also consider partnering \\nwith nongovernmental organ izations ( NGOs )/civil society organizations ( CSOs ) within the project areas to exploit existing \\nplatforms to manage some of these social risks as needed. The contracts under the subprojects are also recommended \\nto include the requirements for adoption of a  code of conduct guiding the responsibilities of the contractors and their \\nlabor. To further manage the risks of GBV/SEA , the PIU will work with HR personnel of entities implementing the \\nsubprojects to include protection against sexual exploitation and abu se content in staff inductions, including all \\ncontractors, consultants, temporary staff , and casual laborers. The PIU will also work with HR to ensure that procedures \\nto guard against hiring persons who have a record of SEA offences are put in place and ap plied . \\n \\n92. The project applies ESS 5 on Land Acquisition, Restrictions on Land Use and Involuntary Resettlement due to \\npossibility of land acquisition and/or physical and economic displacement of persons  in component 2. Activities under \\nthis component may involve direct financing of communication infrastructure construction, such as laying of ducts and \\nestablishment of other ancillary infrastructure, for example , access routes. Initial project screening and experiences fr om \\nthe RCIP -TZ, however, indicate that land acquisition and involuntary resettlement of people will be minimal, as the bulk \\nof these activities will mainly follow existing road reserves. Network alignment will also be adjusted to address any risks \\nof affec ting sites of cultural significance.  \\n \\n93. Since the project’s footprint is largely unknown at this stage, a n RPF has been prepared in consultation with \\nrelevant stakeholders and disclosed in country on November 18, 2019  and by the WB on November 20, 2019 . Thes e \\ndocuments have been updated in detail and the revised versions were posted on the MCIT website on November 9, \\n2020.  Further stakeholder consultations on the project and the draft documents took place on November 23, 2020 and \\nFebruary 10, 2021  and the out comes of these consultations have been document ed in the project’s SEP. The final RPF \\nwas disclosed in -country on March  18, 2021  and on the World Bank ’s external website on the March  19, 2021 . The RPF \\nprovides guidance on the process for preparing, reviewing, approving, and implementing site -specific R APs where \\nnecessary and before  the commencement of any civil works. The RPF also provides guidance on the process of land \\n \\n28 Under the DTP, the term Vulnerable Groups  has been used to define communities that are described in ESS 7 and meet the \\ncriteria set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 of this standard.   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 34 \\n \\nacquisition, valuation of losses attributed to the project, public consultations for the purposes of land and involuntary \\ndisplacement, establishment of a functional grievance handling mechanism , and disclosure requirements. Should a \\nprivate provider undertake any new investment s in infrastructure and related civil works to provide these services, they \\nwill be required to use the RPF to guide their land acquisition and resettlement and thereby conform to national laws \\nand policies as well as the requirements of W B Environmental F ramework’s ESS 5.   \\n \\n94. The implementation of sub-component 2.2 (Rural Broadband for Development ) and sub-component 3.3 b \\n(Citizen Digital Literacy ), whose coverage are nationwide , may positively impact the underserved communities in the \\nrural areas who have been left out of access to mobile and data communications by improving access. The activities \\nfinanced by sub-component 3.3 b will be made accessible, culturally sensitive , and i n language understandable to these \\ncommunities to raise their awareness of government online services and increase their uptake. The project consulted \\nrepresentatives of the vulnerable groups  (as defined by the criteria in ESS  7 paragraphs 8 and 9  of the W orld Bank \\nEnvironmental and Social Framework ) at the national level on February 10, 2021 and the outcomes of this consultation \\nwill guide project design and the preparation of the VGPF as required by ESS 7.   The VGPF will be prepared before  project \\neffecti veness  and will be reviewed and cleared by the World Bank before  its implementation. The VGPF will lay out the \\nsteps  to be followed to promote sustainable development benefits and opportunities in a manner that is accessible and \\nculturally appropriate/inclusive for the subprojects implemented in vulnerable group interest areas after project \\napproval but before project i mplementation.  \\n \\n95. ESS 8 on cultural heritage  applies to the program due to possible impact on tangible/intangible cultural resources \\nthat may be encountered during the implementation of civil works related to the project implementation , such as \\ntrenching for  laying of cables, clearing areas for the installation of masts, and development of access roads. These risks \\nwill be assessed and managed through the cultural resources and chance -find procedures provided in the ESMF and in \\nthe site -specific ESIAs and the ir ESMPs. In addition, chance -find procedures will be included in both the contractor’s \\nESMP and supervised by the construction supervision consultants and the service providers implementing the project.  \\n \\n96. To build capacity of the PIU under component 4, one Social Specialist  (SS) and one Environmental Specialist  (ES) \\nwho are familiar with WB procedures and approaches to social risk management will be recruited to support in the \\nproject ’s Environmen t and Social Risk Management ( ESRM), which will include bu t not be limited to: ( a) stakeholder \\nengagement and management; ( b) implementation of the ESMF, RPF , and the coordination of preparation of site -specific \\nRAPs, ESMPs , and ESIAs; ( c) social inclusion; and ( d) grievance redress management. The specialists will also be \\nresponsible for the monitoring and reporting on the implementation of the ESRM  in the project. In addition, the social \\nspecialist will also work with service providers contracted under the projec t to require the use of the RPF to inform their \\nown land acquisition and resettlement policies and practices.  \\n \\n97. ESS 10 Stakeholder Engagement and Information Disclosure . The project footprint is not yet fully defined and \\nthus consultations under the project  were done with stakeholders at the national level on three occasions. The first \\nround of consultations was conducted during the preparation of the ESMF and RPF between April 23, 2018 and May 11, \\n2018 with government agencies, service providers, academic i nstitutions , and regulatory authorities. Additional \\nconsultations at the national level with CSOs ` and members of the public w ere conducted on November 23, 2020. For \\nthe second round of consultation with CSOs the draft ESMF and RPF were disclosed online by  the MCIT; the consultations \\nwere advertised in two local dailies in both Kiswahili and in English; and targeted invitations were also sent to CSOs at \\nthe national level. Consultations were also conducted by the MCIT with the CSOs representing vulnerable groups through \\nboth a physically and virtually attended meeting on February 10,  2021. As required by ESS 10 on Information Disclosure \\nand Stakeholder Engagement , the project has a n SEP which includes : (a) the establishment of a functional grieva nce \\nredress mechanism ( GRM ) with requirements of preparation of protocols to guide receipt and management of cases of  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 35 \\n \\nGBV  and SEA and sexual harassment and (b) the identification of stakeholders to be involved during project \\nimplementation . The SEP  present s an overall approach to the participation and inclusion of a range of stakeholders \\nincluding governmental and nongovernmental actors. Nongovernmental actors are local -level organizations, as noted \\nabove, and national -level organizations representing persons with disabilities, vulnerable groups , and other interest \\ngroups.  The ESF documents , ESMF, RPF, SEP and the ESCP  were disclosed in -count ry on March  18, 2021  and on the WB’s \\nexternal website on March  19, 2021 . \\n \\n98. During project preparation , there was an outbreak of a global pandemic , that is , COVID -19. The project’s SEP has \\ntherefore incorporated guidelines for conducting consultation in the event of pandemic outbreaks during project \\nimplementation. These guidelines include: ( a) guidance on consultations where face -to-face interactions are a must; ( b) \\nprocesses to follow and basic requirements in conducting virtual/remote consultations; and ( c) alternative platforms for \\nstakeholder engagement and consultation where fa ce-to-face interactions are not permitted. The preparation and \\nimplementation of site -specific SEPs and stakeholder engagement in the subprojects will therefore ensure meaningful \\nconsultations while complying with the project ’s SEP . The GoT and World Healt h Organization (WHO) provided \\nguidelines on global pandemics  Infection Prevention and Control .  \\n \\n99. Citizen Engagement.  The project has a robust citizen engagement strategy that is defined in the SEP with a \\ngrievance mechanism. As an indicator of citizen engagement  (CE), the project will track the number of grievances \\nreceived and addressed with in 30 days. The project will also track user sa tisfaction with the delivery of government \\nservices , through the results framework . Also, effective consultations with project -affected persons  (PAPs)  and project \\nbeneficiaries will take place during implementation. C E will be reported on in the project’s quarterly reports.  \\n \\nV. GRIEVANCE REDRESS SERVICES  \\n \\n100. Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected by a W B supported project may \\nsubmit complaints to existing project -level grievance redress mechanisms or the WB’s Grievance Redress Service \\n(GRS).  The GRS ensures that complaints received are promptly reviewed in order to address project -related concerns. \\nProjec t affected communities and individuals may submit their complaint to the WB’s independent Inspection Panel \\n(IP) which determines whether harm occurred, or could occur, as a result of WB non -compliance with its policies and \\nprocedures. Complaints may be sub mitted at any time after concerns have been brought directly to the W B\\'s \\nattention, and WB Management has been given an opportunity to respond.  For information on how to submit \\ncomplaints to the W B’s G RS, please visit http://www.worldbank.org/en/projects -operations/products -and-\\nservices/grievance -redress -service . For information on how to submit complaints to th e W B IP, please visit \\nwww.inspectionpanel.org .  \\n \\nVI. KEY RISKS  \\n \\n101. The overall risk to achiev ing the PDO is rated as Moderate . The main residual risks arise from the macroeconomic \\nenvironment, including the impact of the COVID -19 pandemic , and the fiduciary environment . Table 2 summari zes the \\nanticipated risks, the mitigation measures and the consequent residual risk.  \\n   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 36 \\n \\nTable 2: Risk and Mitigation Measures  \\nRisk Category and Key Risks  Summary Mitigation Measures  Residual Risk  \\nPolitical and governance  Moderate  \\n• Restructuring of counterpart \\norgani zations, most notably the creation \\nof the MCIT from the former MWTC . \\n• Involvement of many different \\nministries and agencies in the PSC .  • IAs are working in close collaboration with line \\nministries, regional governments, and LGAs.  \\n• Continuity with governance structure for RCIP -TZ \\nproject, which was successfully implemented.   Political and governance: \\nModerate . Although t he \\nability of the project to \\ninfluence political and \\ngovernance risk  is limited, \\nfor the moment  the risks \\nappear moderate. This \\nwill continue to be \\nmonitored during project \\nimplementation.  \\n  \\nMacroeconomic: Substantial  \\n• Economic slowdown, notably impacts \\nfrom COVID -19 global pandemic , and on \\nthe ability of the private sector to \\nmobilize capital . \\n• Pandemic is associated with increased \\ncost of service delivery and reduced \\naffordability . • The pandemic is increasing the level of demand for \\ndigital servic es, which the project proposes to \\nimprove.  \\n• Overall, the broader economic situation is not likely \\nto undermine the sustainability of investments \\nmade under the proposed project, as it does not rely \\non any financial commitments or matching funds \\nfrom the gov ernment , though it does anticipate \\nPCM . \\n• Pandemic recovery phase marked by higher rates of \\neconomic growth . Macroeconomic: \\nModerate  due to the \\nimpact of the COVID -19 \\npandemic  on the project, \\nwhich remain uncertain \\nbut could still greatly \\naffect implementation  \\nand PCM . Nevertheless, \\nrisk exposure is reduced \\ndue to no requirement for \\nfinancing by the \\nGovernment.  \\n  \\nSector strategies and policies: \\nSubstantial  \\n• Existing strategy and policy documents \\nare not considered robust enough to \\nensure an open and competitive \\ntelecom market . For instance , the lack \\nof data protection legislation  may be a \\ndeterrent to foreign investment in the \\nsector . \\n• Expectation of preferential treatment by \\ngovernment for TTLC, for instance in \\nrural broadband and in contracts for \\ngovernment services.  • The project encourages private sector -led \\ndevelopments, based on the MFD approach, \\nincluding using competitive tendering mechanisms \\nfor the pre -purchase of internet capacity (Sub -\\ncomponent 2.1) and the competitive allocat ion of \\nproject funds for expansion of rural broadband using \\nreverse auctions (Sub -component 2.2).  \\n•  Component 3.2 will support the development of a \\ndigital economy strategy that will provide the \\nframework for the government’s digital strategy. \\nThis activit y will be implemented early to make sure \\nthat, moving forward, the government strategy and \\naccompanying policies integrate a digital -first \\napproach.  \\n• A regulatory scan is planned as well as a thorough \\nprogram of capacity building and stakeholder \\nconsultati on is being pursued under the program, \\nnotably under sub-component 3.3. A, and a forward -\\nlooking approach to technology adoption is being \\ntaken, as detailed in the sections above.  Sector strategies and \\npolicies: Moderate. T he \\nproject uses competitive \\ntend ering based on an \\nMFD approach, and \\nincludes a series of \\nactivities on digital \\neconomy to be \\nimplemented early in the \\nproject.  \\n  \\nTechnical design of the project: \\nSubstantial  • To mitigate these risks, preparatory studies and \\nfeasibility studies will be commissioned at an early Technical design of the \\nproject: Moderate, as the  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 37 \\n \\nRisk Category and Key Risks  Summary Mitigation Measures  Residual Risk  \\n• While there is a  natural progression \\nfrom what was implemented under the \\nRCIP -TZ, new technologies will \\nnevertheless be adopted under the DTP  \\n(for instance, use of national remaining \\nand newer generation of mobile \\ntechnologies under sub-component 2.2 \\non rural broadband for development), \\nand this introduces some element of \\nrisk.  \\n• There are also risks associated with the \\naffordability of these new technologies. \\nThis will require a deeper technical \\nknowledge within the implementing \\nagencies.   \\n• There was no project preparation \\nadvance , which mean t that some \\nproject preparation activities could not \\nbe started early .  stage to ensure that there i s a high level of \\ntechnological adaptation and to provide for ‘learning \\nby doing’ on the part of the PIU. The private sector, \\nwhich has a good understanding of these \\ntechnologies, will lead in the implementation of sub-\\ncomponent 2.2 . \\n• To mitigate this risk,  the project will leverage web - \\nand cloud -enabled digital solutions as much as \\npossible to closely supervise project \\nimplementation, such as the bi -weekly virtual \\nmeetings between the IA and the WB, which have \\nbeen a feature of the preparation phase.  mitigation strategies are \\nimplemented early to \\nensure  a sound design.  \\nInstitutional capacity for \\nimplementation and sustainability: \\nSubstantial  \\n• The new Ministry has limited \\nimplementation experience with WB \\nprojects.  \\n• Absorption capacity may be  low.  \\n• The creation of the new MCIT from the \\nformer MWTC introduces further \\ncomplications.  • Building on successful implementation of RCIP -TZ, \\nwith several members of the implementation team \\nreunited, including the project manager.  \\n• Moving to a single PIU under the DTP  should help \\nmitigate capacity risks.  \\n• Fiduciary functions will be  strengthened through \\nfurther capacity building and designation of \\ndedicated staff financed under the project.  \\n• Component 4 will provide TA and capacity building \\nfor project coordination and activities, including \\ncross -cutting issues.  \\n• Core functionalities and project management \\nactivities will be targeted first, and the project will \\nbe built from the basics.  \\n• The WB will be proactive to encourage close \\ncoordination between several government \\nagencies, including the Office of the Presiden t, the \\nMinistry of Finance  and Planning (MoFP) , the \\nMCIT, COSTECH, under the leadership of a strong \\nproject steering committee and management \\nteam, and the participation of the private sector \\nfor the successful achievement of the project PDO.  Institutional  capacity for \\nimplementation and \\nsustainability: Moderate, \\nas the PIU will capitalize \\non prior PIU knowledge of \\nrecent Bank -financed \\nprojects, and experience \\ngained during project \\npreparation.   \\nFiduciary: Substantial  \\n• Creation of new Ministry (MCIT) from \\nformer MWTC.  • Moving to a single PIU , rather than the dual PIU \\nstructure used during RCIP -TZ, will reduce \\nprocurement delays.  Fiduciary: Substantial29, \\nas majority of mitigation \\nmeasures are to still to be \\n \\n29 Residual fiduciary risk has been assessed at the appraisal stage, considering  actual and planned mitigation measures at the start of project \\nimplementation. These will be continually reviewed and updated during implementation. Once the mitigation measures have been successfully \\nimplemented, the fiduciary risk will likely be re -evaluated as Moderate.    The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 38 \\n \\nRisk Category and Key Risks  Summary Mitigation Measures  Residual Risk  \\n• Staff have inadequate experience in \\nmanaging procurement of complex \\nworks, goods, and consulting work . \\n• Inadequate number of procurement \\nteam members to cope with volume of \\nprocurement transactions . \\n• The government prefers to staff the PIU \\nwith its own staff rather than external \\nsupport from consultants .   • Capacity -building interventions will be financed \\nunder the project.  \\n• Required staff will be hired by the IAs to fill the \\ncapacity gap identified during the FM and \\nprocurement capacity assessment.  \\n• Continuous training on W B financial management \\npolicies and d isbursement procedures.  \\n• WB fiduciary colleagues will be proactive in \\nproviding training as required.  \\n• The PIU should consider recruiting additional staff \\nmembers who are familiar with WB internal policies \\nand procedures, as recommended during the FM \\nassess ment  \\n  rolled out during \\nimplementation. (More \\ndetail provided in annex \\n1) \\n  \\nEnvironmental and social: Moderate  \\n• MCIT is a new ministry and its present \\ninstitutional capacity on safeguards \\nneeds strengthening . \\n• Exclusion of vulnerable groups, women, \\nelderly, and disabled persons in the \\nconsultation process of subproject \\nactivities.  \\n• GBV/SEA risk in the project is rated low.  • Capacity -building activities are included in the ESCP. \\nMCIT and PO -PSMGG will receive specific trainings \\nduring implementation.  DTP will develop and \\nimplement measures and actions to assess and \\nmanage the risks of gender -based violence ( GBV ) \\nand sexual exp loitation and abuse -sexual \\nharassment ( SEA). \\n• Provisions for inclusion and requirements for \\nengagement have been included in the SEP and \\nVGPF to guide implementation of all subprojects.  \\n• The PIU will hire one Environmental Specialist and \\none Social Specialis t to oversee Environmental and \\nSocial Risk Management in project implementation.  Environmental and social: \\nModerate, the risks are \\nnot likely to be significant \\nand are easily mitigated in \\na predictable manner.  \\nStakeholder s: Moderate  \\n• Although there is a large number of \\nbeneficiary stakeholders under the \\nproposed project, and although the \\npandemic makes coordination more \\ndifficult, they are nevertheless fewer \\nthan for the RCIP -TZ, which was \\nsuccessfully implemented.  \\n• Lack of understandi ng or ownership of \\nactivities could lead to misalignment or \\ninefficient implementation.  • Stakeholder consultations, both virtual and face -to-\\nface, will be used as a mechanism for promoting \\noutreach and sharing best practices, feedback, and \\noversight, and th e proposed TC reporting to the PSC \\nwill include private sector representatives.  \\n• The GoT is working on modalities to enhance the \\nmanagement of the NICTBB and ICT infrastructures.   \\n• The project will have a GRM to receive and address \\nconcerns from stakeholders /beneficiary \\ncommunities  in a timely manner.   Stakeholder involvement: \\nModerate, as there is a \\nstakeholder engagement \\nplan and national \\nconsultations have been \\ncompleted . This  will \\ncontinue to be assessed  \\nduring the project \\nimplementation.  \\nOther risks are Low.  \\n• Security risks  \\n• Climate change risks  • Risks will continue to be monitored throughout the \\nproject .

The MCIT will be responsible for the implementation of the SEP, ESCP, LMP, VGPF, RPF , and ESMF. The MCIT and all \\nproject implementation partners will prepare site -specific LMP, VGP, ESMP , and RAPs and update the SEP with site -specific \\ndetails as they are known as necessary for each of the subprojects of the DTP. The MCIT will need to recru it one SS and one \\nES who will work closely with the project coordinator and the contractors in implementing and monitoring site -specific plans \\nprepared for the subprojects. Both the SS and ES will help the project staff and the relevant subproject contract ors in the \\nimplementation of the project standard documents and site -specific plans prepared for the subprojects. The SS and ES will \\nmonitor and report on the status of the ESRM  implementation in all relevant subprojects of the DTP. \\n \\nFiduciary Arrangements  \\n \\nFinancial Management Arrangements  \\n \\n2. FM assessment was carried out in line with the World Bank Policy on IPF issued on November 10, 2017.  \\n3. The project will be implemented by the MCIT and the PO -PSMGG. The MCIT and the PO -PSMGG jointly implemented \\nthe RCIP -TZ, and the project will build on the lessons learned from  it. The FM arrangements under the RCIP -TZ were \\nsatisfactory for both ministries.  There are no overdue audit reports or ineligible expenditures awaiting refund by either \\nministry.  \\n4. Budgeting Arrangements.  The MCIT and PO -PSMGG will submit the annual work plan and budget (AWPB) based on the \\nagreed work program to be financed. The annual  AWPB will be consolidated by the PIU and submitted to the Task Team \\nLeader ( TTL), by April 30 each year, for no -objection by the TTL. Also, AWPB preparation will comply with the government \\nbudget calendar and will be included in the Medium -Term Expenditure Framework  of the MCIT and PO -PSMGG , respectively, \\nconsistent with the Budget Act of 2015 and Budget Reg ulations of 2015. The ministry uses the Central Budget Management \\nSystem  for budget documentation purpose s which is linked to the Integrated Financial Management Information System  \\nGovernment Financial System codes. The project will incorporate the AWPB in  the Interim Financial Reports ( IFRs), and for \\nmonitoring purposes, the project will establish the variance between the budget and actuals and provide explanations for \\nany significant variances, and how the project management plans to address them. The Wor ld Bank will monitor the \\nimplementation of the work plan and budget through the IFR’s reviews and during the periodic implementation support \\nsupervision missions.  \\n5. Accounting . The PIU will use the World Bank Client Connection Payments System for the project, and this will be \\ndocumented in the project Financial Procedure Manual (FPM), which forms a part of the PIM. The accounting activities will \\ninclude the management of bank ac counts using the payment process of the Tanzania Inter -Banking Settlement System \\n(TISS) , and reconciliations, assets recording and management, accounting of commitments and accrued \\nexpenditures/liabilities, and preparation of annual PFS will be documented in the FPM. The project has developed the PIM \\nand the FPM, and they have integrated comments from the WB fiduciary experts. These are required to be finalized and \\napproved by the World Bank by the date of project effectiveness .. The PIM will include the de tails of the FPM. The books of \\naccounts to be maintained specifically for the project will include cash book, ledgers, journals, fixed asset register , and \\ncontract register. The accounts codes (Chart of Accounts) for the project will include the classifica tions of sources and \\napplication of funds (expenditures). The accounting department is headed by a chief accountant and s/he will be responsible \\nfor supervising the project accountants.

Internal Control Arrangements . Adequate internal control systems are in place at the MCIT and PO -PSMGG. The PIU \\nhas built on the internal controls that existed under the RCIP -TZ and have put in place satisfactory levels of segregation of \\nduties  for the project. The internal controls wi ll ensure that the funds are utilized for the purpose intended. The manual \\ndescribes the accounting system including transaction cycles , funds flow processes , accounting records, supporting \\ndocuments, the accounting processes from the initiation of a trans action to its reporting , and the financial reporting process \\nto be used for the preparation of the financial statements.  \\n7. Internal Audit Function . The internal auditors of the MCIT and PO -PSMGG will be responsible for the internal audit \\nactivities of the pr oject. The project will use ministries’ line internal control units for internal audit activities of the project. \\nThe internal audit uses the risk -based audit approach to carry out its work. The internal audit will submit quarterly internal \\naudit reports to the head of the PIU and the PSs of the MCIT and PO -PSMGG. The external auditor’s report will also be \\nsubmitted to the World Bank six months  after the end of each financial year.     \\nFunds Flow Arrangements  \\n \\n8. Adequate funds flow arrangements are in place.  The project will maintain a single US dollar DA at the BoT and a project \\nbank account in Tanzania n shilling s at a commercial bank for the purposes of implementing the project. The proceeds of the \\nloan will flow from the World Bank into the DA held at the BoT. Funds from the DA at the BoT will be used for expenditure \\nthat does not exceed the agreed threshold, and  the operational account at the commercial bank will be used for payment of \\nminor expenditures of the project. The diagram below shows the fund s flow arrangement. The project will submit a cash flow \\nforecast for six months, against which the initial disbur sement will be based. Subsequent disbursements will be based on six \\nmonths forecast net of cash balance at the end of the quarter to which the IFRs relate.  \\nDisbursement Methods  \\n \\n9. The project allows four disbursement methods including advance, reimbursement, direct payment , and special \\ncommitments. Under the advance method the project will disburse against six -monthly cash forecasts. The project will submit \\na six -months cash forecast for the initial disbursement. Subsequent disbursements will be  based on six -month cash forecast \\nnet of the closing cash balance for the previous quarter. Details of the disbursement methods are enshrined in the World \\nBank Disbursement Handbook, and they will be included in the Disbursements and Financial Information Letter  (DFIL). The \\nDFIL was agreed at negotiations (April 22 -23, 2021) and will be issued by project effectiveness.  \\n  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 50 of 93  \\n     \\nFigure 2: Proposed Funds Flow Arrangement  \\n \\n  \\nIDA \\nProject Designated Account \\nin BoT (USD)  \\n \\nProject Operating Account \\nin commercial bank (TZS)  \\nPayment to suppliers, vendors and project eligible \\nexpenses   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 51 of 93  \\n     \\nTable 3.

S \\nOverall FM Risk Rating  S The overall FM risk is considered is Substantial30. S \\nNote:  H = High , S = Substantial , M = Moderate , L = Low. \\n \\nProcurement Arrangements  \\n \\n10. Procurement Procedures: Procurement for the project will be carried out in accordance with the ’World Bank \\nProcurement Regulations for IPF Borrowers under Investment Project Financing ’, dated November 2020  (hereafter referred \\nto as ‘Procurement Regulations ’); Guidelines on Preventing and Combating Fraud and Corruption in Projects Financed by \\nIBRD Loans and IDA Credits and Grants (revised July 1, 2016); and the provisions stipulated in the Financing Agreement .  \\n \\n11. PPSD  and PP . As required by the Procurement Regul ations, a PPSD has been developed and revised to take account of \\ninputs from WBG fiduciary specialists. It was approved by the WB on April 9 , 2021 and agreed at negotiations. Based on the \\nPPSD, a PP to cover activities for at least the first 18 months has been prepared to set out the selection methods to be \\nfollowed by the Recipient in the procurement of goods, works, non -consulting services, and consulting services financed by \\nthe WB. The PP will be updated at least every 12 months, or as required, to reflect the actual project implementation needs. \\nEach update of the PP shall require WB approval. All PPs will be publicly disclosed in accordance with the WB disclosure \\npolicy . For each  contract to be eligible for financing by the credit, different procurement methods, estimated costs, prior \\nreview requirements, and time frame will be agreed upon between the Government and the Wb in the PP.  \\n \\n12. STEP . The W B’s system will be used to prepare, clear, and update PPs and conduct all procurement transactions for \\nactivities under the project. As part of the preparation, MCIT and PO -PSMGG staff have been trained in STEP.  \\n \\n13. Procurement Publications . The MCIT in consultation with the PO-PSMGG will be required to prepare and submit to the \\nWB a General Procurement Notice. The WB will arrange for its publication in United Nation s Development Business (UNDB) \\nonline  and on the WB’s external website. Specific Pr ocurement Notices for all international competitive procurements and \\nRequests for Expressions of Interest for all consultancies estimated to cost not less than US$300,000 shall be published in a t \\n \\n30 Residual fiduciary risk has been assessed at the appraisal stage, considering actual and planned mitigation measures at the s tart of project \\nimplementation.

Procurement Templates . The WB’s Standard Procurement Docume nts (SPDs) shall be used for procurement of goods, \\nworks, and non -consulting services under International Competitive Procurement. National bidding documents may be used \\nunder National Procurement Procedures (NPP) subject to the exceptions stipulated in th e textual part of the PP. Similarly, \\nthe selection of consultant firms shall use the  WB’s SPDs, in line with procedures described in the Procurement Regulations.   \\n \\n15. Public procurement in Tanzania is governed by an act (P ublic Procurement Act) that was amended and became \\neffective on July 7, 2016 . The associated Regulations for the amended act have been published. The act will be applied for \\nprocurements below the defined thresholds involving NPP . Under the act, procurement functions remain decentralized  to \\nprocuring entities with the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) continuing to provide oversight functions in \\npublic procurement. In addition, the amended act has maintained the definitions of fraud and corruption with regard to \\ncoercive prac tices, collusive practices, and obstructive practices. The amendments have been published in the Government \\nGazette of the United Republic of Tanzania (URT) No.28 Vol.97 dated July  8, 2016 and Government Notice No. 333 of \\nDecember  30, 2016 , respectively. The reasons for the above amendments were the long duration of procurement processes, \\nissues with integrity and professionalism, constraints to commercially oriented government companies/institutions, lack of \\nand failure to apply approved st andards for common items and services required by the GoT, and differences in procurement \\nprocedures used by LGAs and those used by other procuring entities. The need for approval of exceeded budget, previously \\nrequired from approving authority, has also b een amended. The amendments also emphasize submitting details , not just a \\nlist of procurement contracts awarded and the use of the Procurement Management Information System. The amended act \\nalso protects local content and firms. Furthermore, the amended regulations stipulate that contracts exceeding TZS 1  billion \\nwill need vetting by the Attorney General’s Office before  signing. This is an increase from the previous threshold of TZS 50 \\nmillion.  \\n \\n16. The amended act has also reduced the cool -off period from 14 days to 7 days , during which time an intention to award \\nthe contract is communicated to all bidders , giving them an opportunity to submit a complaint if any on the proposed \\naward.  Furthermore, the procurement complaint review was changed to a two -tier proc ess, with the PPRA no longer involved \\nin the review of complaints  (see figure 3). Thus, this leads to a substantial reduction in the overall time for handling \\ncomplaints. Otherwise, the overall basic principles of the public procurement and general institu tional arrangements have \\nremained the same. The amendment has introduced, among others: ( a) mandatory inclusion of local firms and experts in \\nconsultancy contracts; ( b) domestic preference for both international and national competitive bidding  (NCB) ; (c) a \\nrequirement to set  aside contracts to be used for capacity building of local firms; and ( d) a requirement to set  aside contracts \\nbelow a set threshold to be awarded to local firms only.  \\n \\n   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 54 of 93  \\n     \\nFigure 3: Revisions to procurement complain ts review process  \\n \\n  \\n \\n17. For better implementation of the amended act, a set of regulations have been issued; the Public Procurement \\nRegulations 2016  and Government Notice No. 121 of April 22, 2016. These are supplemented by the LGAs’ (Establishment \\nand Proceeding of the Tender Boards) Government Notice No.177 of 2007 for procurements under the LGAs. In line with the \\nissued regulations, various documents as working tools have been issued, including Standard Bidding Documents \\n(Procurement of Works, Procure ment of Goods , and Procurement of Non -consulting Services), Standard Request for \\nProposals, Guidelines on the Tenders Evaluation (Works, Goods , and Non -consulting Services), Guidelines on the Technical \\nand Financial Proposals Evaluation and Report Preparat ion, Guidelines for Preparing Responsive Proposals, Guidelines for \\nPreparing Responsive Bids , and Procedural Forms. All these documents are accessible on the PPRA’s website free of charge.  \\n \\n18. The amended act has been reviewed by the W B and found to be satisfactory to a large extent , except for the following \\nprovisions: ( a) there will be no preference accorded to domestic suppliers and contractors under NCB for goods, non -\\nconsulting services, and works under this project; ( b) there shoul d be no mandatory requirement for inclusion of local experts \\nand firms for the consulting assignments; ( c) negotiations with the lowest evaluated bidder to reduce price in the case of \\ngoods, works , and non -consulting services where competitive methods have  been used shall not be allowed; ( d) the fixed \\nbudget method shall not be used for goods, works , and non -consulting services; and ( e) procurement standards established \\nand approved by the GoT may be used, provided that they are not restrictive. Furthermore , in accordance with paragraph \\n5.4 of the Procurement Regulations, the following shall be observed: (a) the request for bids/request for proposal documents \\nshall require that bidders/ proposers submitting bids/proposals present a signed acceptance at the ti me of bidding, to be \\n The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 55 of 93  \\n     \\nincorporated in any resulting contracts, confirming application of, and compliance with, the W B’s Anti -Corruption Guidelines, \\nincluding without limitation to the WB’s right to sanction and the WB’s inspection and audit rights and (b) r ights for the WB \\nto review Borrower’s procurement documentation and activities.  \\n \\n19. Procurement of Works . Works contracts procured under this project might include limited deployment of fiber optic \\ncables, wiring of buildings for in -building telecommunications networks (passive infrastructure) and building of ducts; \\nrehabilitation/construction of buildings for  OSSCs ( sub-component 3.1) ; construction of infrastructure for Government \\nCommunications Network (GovNet) extension  (sub-component 2.1) , construction of the ICT Professional Development \\nCenter (sub-component 1.1) and connectivity for last mile and rural broadband connectivity  (sub-component 2.2) . \\nProcurement for goods will use international or national procurement procedures, as guided by Procurement Regulations. \\nFor procurement involving national competitive procurement, the Borrower may use its own procurement documents, \\nacceptable to the WB. Requirements of paragraphs 5.3 to 5.6 of the Procurement Regulations shall be observed when using \\nthe country’s own procurement procedures, subject to the conditions stated in the textual part of the PP.  \\n \\n20. Procur ement of goods . Goods to be procured under this project will include a n ational addressing and postcode system ; \\na national ICT statistics management information system ; government connectivity, r ural broadband for connectivity; \\ngovernment cloud and infrast ructure; and items to support project implementation and monitoring (office equipment and \\nICT equipment for tracking, and so on ). Procurement for goods will use international or national procurement procedures, \\nas guided by procurement regulations. For pro curement involving national competitive procurement, the Borrower may use \\nits own procurement documents, acceptable to the WB. Requirements of paragraphs 5.3 to 5.6 of the Procurement \\nRegulations shall be observed when using the country’s own procurement p rocedures, subject to the conditions stated in \\nthe textual part of the PP. \\n \\n21. Selection of consultants . Consultancy services under this project will include technical support consultancies (d igital \\nyouth, innovation , and talent development for industrial competitiveness, legal, regulatory , and fiscal reform; digital literacy \\nand capacity building ; digital economy —including enhancing digital tax collection, and so on ). The Quality - and Cost -Based \\nSelection (QCBS) selec tion method will be used, whenever possible. Other selection methods, as stipulated in paragraph 7.2 \\nof Section VII of the Procurement Regulations, may also be used. Contracts for consultancy assignments  estimated to cost \\nless than US$300,000 or equivalent  may be contracted through the selection based on the Consultants ’ Qualification s (CQS). \\nShort lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than the equivalent of US$300,000 per contract may be composed  \\nentirely of national consultants in accordance  with relevant procurement regulations. However, if foreign firms express \\ninterest, they will not be excluded from consideration.  \\n \\n22. Operating costs . Operating costs shall consist of operating and maintenance  costs for vehicles, office supplies, \\ncommunication charges, utility charges, travel expenses, per diem and travels costs, office rental, training costs, workshops  \\nand seminars and associated costs, among others. These items will be procured using the Borr ower national procurement \\nand administrative procedures acceptable to the World Bank including selection of project implementation support \\nperson nel. \\n \\n23. Training and workshops . Training and workshops will be based on capacity needs assessment. Detailed training plans \\nand workshops activities will be developed during project implementation and included in the project annual work plan and \\nbudget  (AWPB ) for the W B’s review and appro val. The annual training plan will identify, inter alia : (a) the training envisaged , \\n(b) the justification for the training, ( c) the personnel to be trained; ( d) the duration for such training; and ( e) the estimated \\ncost of the training. At the time of the actual training, the request shall be submitted to the WB for review and approval. \\nUpon completion of the training, the trainees shall be required to prepare and submit a report on the training recei ved.  \\n  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 56 of 93  \\n     \\n24. Project Preparation Advance. The GoT did not request a project preparation advance or the use of retroactive financing \\nunder the project .  \\n \\n25. Procurement Management Arrangements . It is anticipated that a PIU will be set up for implementation of the project. \\nOne procurement staff from each implementing entity (MCIT and PO -PSMGG) will be dedicated to the project and be part of \\nthe established PIU.  \\n \\n26. Procurement risk assessment . Implementation of the project activitie s will generally be mainstreamed within existing \\ngovernment entities and structures. Procurement activities will be managed by a single PIU under the MCIT. This is a different \\napproach than that used under the RCIP -TZ where separate project management unit s were maintained in the MCIT and PO -\\nPSMGG.  \\n \\n27. A capacity assessment of the entities to implement project procurement activities was carried out in January 2019 \\nand in October 2019 . The assessment reviewed the organizational structure, functions, staff skills and experiences, adequacy \\nfor implementing the project, and the interaction between the project staff responsible for procurement. For the MCIT, the \\nProcurement Management Unit  (PMU)  has four staff, who are all relatively new to the MCIT, but three of them have some \\nknowledge of procurement using W B procedures ( old guidelines) before they were transferred to the MCIT ( including \\nSustainable Management of Mineral Resources Project  (P0963 02), Energy Sector Capacity Building Project  (P1268 75), and \\nWater Sector Development Project  (P087154) ). Under the national budget, there has been no national competitive tendering \\nfor the MCIT, with major procurement carried out using restricted tendering procedures. In FY2018/19, the MCIT had a score \\nof 98.4  percent  under a PPRA performance audit. This w as an improvement from the FY2016/17 audit with a score of 75  \\npercent  with major issues identified in the PPRA audit related to ( a) Tender Board members not having received training  on \\nthe Public Procurement Act (PPA) ; (b) the PMU not maintaining and archi ving procurement records; ( c) lack of Tender Board \\napproval for some documents; ( d) tenders not evaluated based on criteria stated in bid documents; ( e) awarding tenders \\nbeyond tender validity period; ( f) no evidence of performance securities for signed co ntracts; ( g) inadequate contract \\nmanagement , including delayed payments ; and ( h) inadequate space and facilities for procurement records. With new MCIT \\nprocurement staff, major issues relate to , (a) inadequate knowledge and skills in WB procurement procedures, particularly \\nthe Procurement Regulations and STEP; ( b) some members of the Tender Board still not trained in the PPA; ( c) inadequate \\ncontract management skills; ( d) inadequate office equipment fo r the staff (computers, printers, scanners, photocopiers) ; and \\n(e) procurement record keeping system needs to be established, although space is no longer an issue. For the PO-PSMGG, \\nthe PMU in Dodoma has a total of five procurement staff. Although three of  the staff were with the PO -PSMGG PMU during \\nthe implementation of the World Bank -financed RCIP -TZ using the old guidelines, their participation was very minimal, with \\nlittle knowledge acquired. Under the national budget, there has been no national competi tive tendering for the PO-PSMGG, \\nwith major procurement carried out using restricted tendering procedures for goods and no consultancy services. In \\nFY2018/19, the PO-PSMGG had a score of 98.43  percent  under a PPRA performance audit. Major issues in the audit related \\nto (a) lack of Tender Security Declarations  and (b) contract management issues including non -adherence to delivery period \\nand goods warranties. For the new project, major issues for the PO-PSMGG relate to ( a) inadequate knowledge and skills in \\nWB procurement procedures, particularly the Procurement Regulations and STEP; ( b) some members of Tender Board still \\nnot trained in the PPA; ( c) inadequate contract management skills; and ( d) the need for a procurement record keeping system \\nto be established.  \\n \\n28. The overall project risk for procurement was assessed as Substantial. The risk would be  reduced to a residual rating of \\nModerate once the  mitigation measures proposed in table 4 are implemented .  \\n \\n \\nTable 4– Procurement Risks and Mitigation Measures  \\n  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 57 of 93  \\n     \\nRisk  Mitigation Measure  Time Frame  Responsibility  \\nInadequate knowledge and \\nskills in WB procurement \\nprocedures, particularly the \\nProcurement Regulations and \\nSTEP .

The PP set s forth those contracts which shall be \\nsubject to the WB’s prior review. All other contracts shall be subject to post review by the W B. A summary of prior  review \\nand procurement approaches and methods thresholds for the project are indicated in tables 5 and 6, based on the \\nprocurement assessment.  \\n \\nTable 5 – Thresholds for Goods, Works , and Non -Consulting Services  \\nCategory  Prior Review (US$ , \\nmillions)  Procurement Approaches and Methods (US$ , millions)  \\nOpen International  Open National  Request for \\nQuotation s \\n(RFQ) \\nWorks  ≥ 10  ≥ 15  < 15 ≤ 0.2  \\nGoods, IT, and non -consulting \\nservices  ≥ 2  ≥ 5 < 5 ≤ 0.1  \\n \\n   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 58 of 93  \\n     \\nTable 6 – Thresholds for Consulting Services  \\nCategory  Prior Review \\n(US$ , millions)  Short List of National Consultants  \\nConsulting \\nServices  Engineering and Construction Supervision  \\nConsultants (Firms)  ≥ 1 ≤ 0.3  ≤ 0.3  \\nIndividual Consultants  ≥ 0.3  n.a. n.a. \\nNote: General - ToR for all contracts shall be cleared by the W B. \\n(a) Shortlist for consultancy services for contracts estimated to be less than US$300,000 equivalent per contract \\nmay be composed entirely of national consultants . \\n(b) Consultancy services for contracts estimated to cost US$300,000 equivalent and above per contract shall be \\nadvertised in UNDB online , Tanzania PPRA, MCIT and PO -PSMGG websites,  and the WB’s external website in \\naddition to advertising in national newspapers  in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.5 of the \\nConsultants ’ guidelines . \\n \\n30. Record keeping.  The implementing entities (MCIT and PO -PSMGG/PIU) will be responsible for record keeping and filing \\nof procurement records for ease of retrieval of procurement information. In this respect, each contract shall have its own file \\nand should contain all documents on the procurement process.  \\n \\n31. Monitoring.  M&E of procurement performance will be carried out through W B implementation support  and post \\nprocurem ent review missions.  On the other hand, the PPRA will monitor a nd evaluate the procurement in line with prevailing \\nTanzania Procurement Regulations.  \\n \\n32. Frequency of Procurement Supervision. In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from WB offices, \\nthe capacity assessment of the implementing agencies recommends one supervision mission every 12 months to visit the \\nfield operations and carry out post review of procurement actions.  \\n \\n   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 59 of 93  \\n     \\nANNEX 2: Detailed Project Description  \\n \\nCOUNTRY: Tanzania   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  \\n \\n1. The DTP aims to assist the country in harness ing its digital potential , ensuring that all citizens and businesses have \\naccess to high -quality, low -cost connectivity ; that public services are easily and securely accessible online ; and that the digital \\neconomy is driving growth, innovation , and job creation. Across the globe, digital technologies are rapidly transforming the \\nway people, businesses , and governments communicate and access information and how they transact and deliver services. \\nTanzania has the opportunity to embrace this trend , taking proactive steps to ensure that its citizens, businesses , and \\ninstitutions are equipped to participate, innovate , and flourish in an increasingly online, digital -first environment. This vision \\nwill require a long -term commitment to making the inves tments and policy reforms needed to increase connectivity, spur \\nprivate sector ICT investment and innovation, and develop a new generation of digital leaders and creatively us e technology \\nto improve the efficiency and impact of public services.  \\n \\n2. Tanzania has made notable strides in the development of digital public services applications and delivery capacity in \\nrecent years, but significant gaps and opportunities for leapfrogging remain.  The RCIP -TZ facilitated the development and \\npiloting of a nu mber of digital services and platforms. These include the national business portal, a digital birth registration \\nsystem, e -procurement, e -office applications for the g overnment, telemedicine , and a mobile services portal which host s \\nservices such as utilit y bill notifications, health insurance verification and tracking, pension notifications, fuel price \\nnotifications, voter verification , and government job application , amongst others. Nonetheless, the country ranks 139 out of \\n193 countries in the 2018 UN e -Government index, an improvement since 2014 (146), but behind regional peers such as \\nRwanda (120) and Kenya (122). Many piloted applications have only recently been completed and are yet to be scaled up to \\nreach a broad range of users. With the increasing access to connectivity, there is nearly unlimited scope to increase digital \\npublic services offerings. Technological and business model innovations have likewise created opportunities to leverage \\nsignificant cost savings, reduce the time for deployment , and increase impact of new digital services by sharing IT \\ninfrastructure, software, data , and HR across all government service delivery entities.  \\n \\n3. This ambitious program will follow a phased approach.  This project focusses on strengthening Tanzania’s core Digital \\nFoundations —closing the connectivity gap, increasing market competitiveness and investment, and strengthening the \\ndigitally enabled service delivery infrastructure and capacity within the gove rnment. It is possible to envisage a second phase, \\nor additional financing, that would focus on Tanzania’s Digital Acceleration , leveraging improved connectivity and enhanced \\ncapacity for public digital service d elivery to accelerate growth of the digital economy, encouraging private and public \\ninnovation utilizing digital technology, strengthening and deepening robust cybersecurity capabilities for the digital economy, \\nand supporting the expansion of digital publ ic services offerings across key sectors. Both phases will involve collaboration \\nwith education and health sector initiatives as well as with the private sector to strengthen digital skills development to e quip \\ncitizens and businesses with the capability t o use technology to improve their livelihoods today and to thrive in the digital \\neconomy of tomorrow.   \\n \\n4. The Borrower has requested an estimated IDA financing  envelope of US$ 150 million to support the DTP. The \\nachievements of this project are expected to i nclude: ( a) addressing barriers to enhanced telecom market competition and \\nprivate investment including adoption and enforcement of policies on Open Access and Infrastructure Sharing for the \\nbackbone communications infrastructure; ( b) substantially raising the percentage of Tanzania’s citizens that can access \\nbroadband internet services; and ( c) improved government efficiency and ability to deliver services to citizens in a more \\neffective, timely, decentralized , and cost -efficient way  by leveraging shared government communications infrastructure and \\nthe OSSCs.   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 60 of 93  \\n     \\n \\n5. A number of interrelated factors are constraining private sector investment and competitiveness critical to closing \\nTanzania’s digital divide and creating a strong foundation fo r growth of the digital economy. These include:  \\n \\n(a) Underinvestment in backbone network infrastructure. Low-cost, high -quality , and geographically widespread \\nfiber -optic backbone networks are essential to provision of telecom services. To date, the NICTBB has deployed \\n7,910 km of fiber, though a total of 15,000 km are targeted by 2025. A lso the network has too few loops to create \\nsufficient redundancy to protect from cuts, especially for cross -border links. The network reportedly suffers from \\nshortage of capacity and lack of reliability  and lacks sufficient points of presence to meet market demand. \\nFurthermore, private operators fa ce significant barriers to investing in their own backbone infrastructure or to \\ncomplete the missing links in the NICTBB .31 High prices for right -of-way further deter investment .32 Prices for \\nwholesale capacity have come down recently , but much more has to be done to attract more usage and investment. \\nPrice trends need to respond  to technological change and market trend s. For ICT infrastructure development and \\ninvestment, the government will have to collaborate with different ICT stakeholders to ensur e improved \\nperformance of the existing infrastructure so as to attain Tanzania’s targets for digital development.    \\n \\n(b) Low levels of income, digital literacy , and domestic market size . Consumers of ICT services are highly price \\nsensitive given the low levels of average income in Tanzania. Combined  with aggressive competition in the mobile \\nretail market, this has led to low marginal revenues for service providers, which  discourages invest ment in \\ninfrastructure and services in rural areas where there isn’t a sufficient customer base to overcome the low margins. \\nThe lack of digital literacy among a wide swathe of the population and lack of relevant digital content (online \\nservices, marketpla ces, information , and media, in local languages), together with low levels of smartphone \\nownership, limit demand for ICT services and suppress the addressable customer base. Addressing these dual \\nchallenges will require interventions to incentivize rollout  of services in rural areas, narrowing the digital literacy \\ngap, creating high demand digital public services , and fostering a domestic and regional environment/market \\nconducive to creation of locally and regionally relevant digital content.  \\n \\n(c) Constrained o nline trust environment.  An uncertain data privacy and protection legislative regime and the need \\nfor strengthening cybersecurity governance, standards, and operational and technical capabilities impede trust in \\nTanzania’s online transaction environment fo r investors and the private sector.  \\n \\n6. The project utilizes the MFD approach  to use limited public funding to leverage the maximum amount of investment \\nfrom the private sector and other development partners, and to ensure a high impact from public investment. The principle \\nunderlying MFD is to use private sector investment in infr astructure, wherever possible, and to use public funds sparingly, as \\na way of leveraging private sector investment. Two examples of this in the project are:  \\n• The use of government pre -purchase of internet capacity under sub-component 2.1, so that the govern ment acts \\nas an anchor tenant to encourage greater network investment;  and \\n• The use of reverse auctions under sub-component 2.2, where public funds are allocated to the operators who can \\nuse them most efficiently.  \\n \\n \\n \\n31 With the exception of Halotel, which has deployed 19,000 km of fiber, primarily in rural areas, whereby a number of fiber pairs on  the network \\nwill eventually be made available for use by the NICTBB. The other major operators , Airtel, Tigo, Vodacom, and Zantel , have been prevented from \\nconstructing their own fiber backbone . Nevertheless, they have formed the Fiber Consortium, which has constructed some 400 km of metro fiber . \\n32 The TARURA charges an initial charge of US$1,000 and an annual charge of US$1,000 per km of fiber. By comparison, there are z ero charges in \\nRwanda while Zambia charges only an initial fee of US$503 per km and no an nual fee.   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 61 of 93  \\n     \\n7. The project places emphasis on creating a conducive enabling environment to encourage private sector investment \\nin infrastructure and services , notably through the regulatory scan in sub -component 1 .1, the studies planned on rural \\nbroadband under sub -component 2.2 and on the digital economy  under sub -component 3.1. Public financing will only be \\nutilized to meet public needs and to address market failures , providing incentives for private sector investment through \\npublic -private partnerships rather than creating competing public infrastructure or services. It will build on the successful \\nprivate partnerships for rural connectivity established under the RCIP -TZ which leveraged more than US$2 in private \\ninvestment for every US$1 in project investment, raising about  US$100 million in total and bringing an additional 2.5  million  \\ncitizens within coverage of mobile networks ; a good example of p rivate capital mobilization . Finally, the increase in digital \\nskills and new digital public service offerings is expected to drive demand for private investment in connectivity and \\ncomplementary digital services and applications, which would be further expanded in a possible additio nal financing later in \\nthe project lifecycle . \\n \\nTable 7: Tanzania’s ICT sector statistics , 2015 -20 \\n  2015  2016  2017  2018  2019  2020  CAGR  \\nMobile subscribers  (millions)  39.67  40.04  39.95  43.50  47.76  51.29 5.3%  \\nMobile internet user s (millions)  16.28  18.01  19.01  22.28  25.79  28.47  11.8%  \\nMonthly traffic (On & Off Net), in \\nmillion minutes  4,156  4,676  5,182  5,365  5,940  7,506  12.7 % \\nSource:  TCRA.

The aim of this component is to make Tanzania a more attractive and competitive place for digital investment and \\ninnovation, ensuring that the benefits of digital technology are reaching all citizens and helping lay the groundwork for \\ngrowth of the digital economy. This will be accomplished by strengthening the many interrelated elements that c haracterize \\na thriving digital ecosystem —creating and implementing forward -looking laws, regulations , and policies; building digital skills \\nand capacity of institutions and youth; developing a critical mass of innovators, entrepreneurs, and support service s; \\ndeveloping a robust local ICT industry that is founded on private investment and is able to deliver e -Commerce services ; \\nstrengthening cybersecurity capacity to detect, prevent , and respond to cyberattacks ; improving data protection and privacy ; \\nand working toward closing the digital divide , ensuring that all citizens benefit from digital development. These goals will be  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 62 of 93  \\n     \\nsupported through four sub -components detailed below. While specific priority activities  have been identified, the design of \\nthe component is intended to remain flexible, allowing the project to respond to new challenges and opportunities as they \\narise in this fast -changing sector.   \\n \\n1.1 Digital Enabling Environment (US$1 3.4 million  equivalent ) \\n \\na) Establishment of the National ICT Professional and Innovation Center  (US$ 10 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n9. The objective of this activity is to develop a center f or ICT professional development and ‘soft centers ’ to promote local \\ninnovation in the country. The implementation of this activity will be carried out in collaboration with academic institution s, \\nvocational training institutions , and the industry. This activity will include the following sub -activities:  \\n \\n(i) Establishment of a Center for ICT Professional Development  \\n \\n10. The objective of this sub -activity is to collaborate on the development of a center for ICT professional development in \\nTanzania. This will cater for skills development and mentorship, identification , and recognition of ICT \\nacademics/professionals. Additionally, the center will allow for easier recruitment of skilled professionals by local compani es \\nand foreign investors, including the export of skills outside Tanzania. Like other Africa n economies, Tanzania has both a \\nshortage of ICT skills as well as a large number of unemployed ICT graduates. The aim of the center, which will be coordinate d \\nby the MCIT  in collaboration with the HLIs, will be to improve the process of matching the skill s of the estimated 5,000 ICT \\nprofessionals in Tanzania and employer requirements. A particular focus will be on improving employment opportunities for \\nfemale ICT professionals. The center will enhance specialized ICT professional skills to support the country’s industrialization \\nagenda which is aligned with the concept of the 4th Industrial Revolution and digital economy competitiveness. Established \\nindustries are increasingly ICT ena bled and require special competencies which few Tanzanians possess at present. These \\ncompetencies require specialized training currently only available in Tanzania, at considerable cost. The advantages of such \\na center include cost reduction , development o f homegrown solutions (local products, services , and content) , and an \\nopportunity to import talent from other countries, hence contributing to the country’s sector growth and digital economy. \\nThe center will also include curriculum on e -waste, digital ener gy efficiency , and other topics that educate students on \\nclimate -friendly digital skills.  \\n \\nii)      Establishment of Dedicated Zonal ‘Soft Centers’ for Youth, Entrepreneurship and SME Development  \\n \\n11. This sub -activity aims to establish dedicated ‘soft centers ’ to build  the local software industry, upskill youth nationwide , \\nand enhance gender participation in digital development. Soft  centers will be established in five zones to provide software \\ndevelop ers with resources and tools countrywide. Consultations with industry, government , and academia have revealed \\nthat formal ICT training programs in Tanzania often fail to provide the hands -on, practical skills demanded in the market. \\nLikewise, youth with ta lent for digital innovation often lack the corresponding business and communications skills needed to \\ncommercialize their ideas or establish and run successful enterprises. The activity will address the following: (a) establish ment \\nof a digital youth inter nship program to place academic graduates within digitally oriented businesses, government \\nMDA/LGA’s IT departments , or digital services units; (b) establishment of up to four  zonal soft  centers to provide digital \\nentrepreneurship opportunities for young people working on digital solutions and products for both private and government \\nuse; and (c) development of guidelines for operationalization of the centers. Special emphasis will be plac ed on attracting \\nfemale participants to the programs and soft  centers to help correct the long -standing gender imbalance in the sector.  The \\nincrease in the number of female employees will be tracked as part of the results framework .  \\n \\n  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 63 of 93  \\n     \\nb) Establishment of FabLabs (US$3 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n12. This activity aims to establish ICT hardware refurbishment centers that will enable the reuse and increased lifetime of \\nICT equipment to complement efforts to distribute ICT equipment to educational institutions. This will also support the \\nacquisition of l ow-cost ICT equipment for learning purposes, as well as building capacity in Tanzania for reusing and \\nprolonging the lifespan of ICT equipment. Reuse is an important strategy to reduce resource -intensive production of ICT \\nequipment and to tackle the growin g challenges of e -waste.  Secondly, the initiative will provide mechanisms for linkages \\nbetween disposal service providers and refurbishment centers for easy management and control. This will be done through \\ncollaboration with vocational and technical train ing institutions. Activities to be supported include establishing FabLabs and \\nTechn ology  Hubs (TechHubs ) in one of the selected technical training institutions  and enhancing  local capacity to support \\nthe development of refurbishment centers for repair, recycling , and distribution of ICT equipment  \\n \\nc) Scanning of ICT Regulatory (Policy, Legal , and Infrastructure) Environment  (US$0. 4 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n13. Under this activity, the MCIT , in cooperation with the TCRA and in consultation with the licensed operators, will conduct \\na quick scan of the legal and policy environment to identify possible gaps that might hinder the development of a secure  \\ndigital econo my in Tanzania, especially broadband implementation. The study will also scan for policies that include carbon \\nemissions for ICT and e -waste management.  The results of the study will provide an information platform for digital \\ndevelopment in Tanzania by re commending new initiatives required to create an enabling regulatory, legal , and fiscal \\nenvironment for the digital economy. This study will also contribute to the development of strategies, guidelines, and \\nstandards for optimization of deployment and usag e of ICT infrastructures in Tanzania.   \\n \\n1.2 Infrastructure to Support National ICT Development and e-Commerce  (US$1 5.3 million  equivalent ) \\n \\na)      Enhancing the National Addressing and Postcode System  (US$1 2 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n14. This is an ongoing activity  which will focus on scale -up of the NSDI, managed by the TCRA, which currently covers 67 \\nwards33, to cover the full territory and population of Tanzania. The NSDI, or digital map, will provide a platform on which a \\nvariety of layers of information can be laid for various purposes, including national digital ID and spatial maps for nationa l \\ndevelopmen t. In the context of national ICT development, it will provide essential support for the further development of e -\\nCommerce, thereby improving tax collection efficiency and economic growth. The program is intended to further cover 13 \\ncities with high revenu e collection , aiming at increasing collection of untapped revenue. The implementation plan includes \\nthe installation of street signage and enhancement of the existing database at the TCRA.   \\n \\nb)     Development of National ICT Statistical Management Information System (NISMIS ) (US$  2 million  \\nequivalent ) \\n \\n15. This activity aims to provide complete, accurate , and current statistical data for ICT networks and services in the country \\nso as to support policy -making decisions for national development. ICT statistics play a vital role in support ing ICT investment \\ngrowth and , more important ly and strategically , econ omic growth in the country. Appropriate ICT applications will achieve \\nefficient statistical undertakings with reliable and accessible data when the need arises. The ministry, recognizing the need \\nfor improved statistics in the sector, will design tools tha t will support collection and analysis of ICT statistics that includes \\nthe programs that are undertaken by the ministry and other departments. The results of these programs/activities will be \\nmonitored and stored by the NISMIS and respectively will be used  for planning, data enumeration, data processing, data \\n \\n33 http://www.address.go.tz/   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 64 of 93  \\n     \\nanalysis, and data dissemination for better decision making. This will also be used by the NBS as part of national statistica l \\nreporting. In addition, it will facilitate investment growth in the ICT se ctor by providing useful data to potential investors.   \\n \\nc)      Tanzania Postal e -Commerce Initiatives  (US$1.3 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n16. Tanzania has been carrying out economic reforms with the objective of achieving higher economic growth by improving \\neconomic infrastructure and social services delivery  and alleviat ing and ultimately eradicat ing poverty by using natural \\nresources sustainab ly with the  aim of becoming a middle -income economy. With the development  of technology, shopping \\nhabits in Tanzania have changed due to the rapid spread of enabling technologies and opportunities such as online shopping \\nand d igital auctions . Digital marke ts and over -the-top platforms have led to  a massive engagement of citizens into e -\\nCommerce. In this regard, the TPC, in collaboration with the UPU’s Ecom@Africa initiative , will join other countries in Africa \\nand globally to engage in digital commerce in new emerging markets across  the world.   \\n \\n17. By joining the Ecom@Africa initiative, Tanzania will gain various benefits such as: (a) positively impacting the provision \\nof the Universal Service Obligation placed on the TPC to ensure that postal services are reasonably accessible to all people in \\nthe URT by enabling rural and underserved communities to market, sell , and purchase online ; (b) becoming the hub for e -\\nCommerce via the UPU international postal network whereby e -Commerce buyers and sellers within eastern and southern \\nAfrican countries will buy and sell their products securely through a trusted hub e -Commerce platform ; and (c) enabling the \\nTanzania Government to share and integrate innovative solutions and capabilities with other member countries.  The \\nimplementation of this activity will begin with a feasibility study to assess e-Commerce readiness , project scoping , and \\nimplementation of process mapping and national digital platforms for e -Commerce development.   \\n \\nComponent 2: Digital Connectivity  (US$62.5 million  equivalent ) \\n18. The aim of this component is to ensure that the government , businesses  and citizens can access high -speed broadband \\nconnectivity. Widespread, affordable , and reliable connectivity is an essential prerequisite to provide and access digital \\nservices for social economic development. In addition to the measures to boost sector competitiveness and private sector \\ninvestment, there is a need for more direct publi c and private investment to meet the connectivity needs of the country. This \\ncomponent will support the government’s agenda for industrialization and equitable spatial development, ensuring that the \\ngovernment and citizens, including those in rural areas, have equivalent access to digital services and opportunities. Further, \\nthe component will provide incentives for the private sector to reduce the digital divide in internet service provision betwe en \\nurban and rural populations. This component will include the following sub -components .  \\n \\n2.1 Connected Government  (US$33.0 million equivalent )  \\n \\n19. This sub -component will support the provision of secure broadband internet to currently unconnected MDAs, LGAs , and \\nother government institutions in rural areas, as part of the GovNet. This will build on the successful GovNet program under \\nthe RCIP -TZ, which connected around  186 MDAs, LGAs, regional hospital s, and regional secretaries. Benefits include lowering \\ncom munication/collaboration costs, affordable international bandwidth, improving efficiency in service provision and \\nrevenue collection by the g overnment through shared electronic platforms which are enabled by GovNet , and providing them \\nwith low -cost interne t bandwidth. A reliable and robust governance, technical , and operational framework for the security \\nof GovNet and its affiliated infrastructure from cyberattacks, hijacking , and breaches is crucial. Activities that will be \\nimplemented include: (a) a feasi bility study to identify priority institutions for connection s based on projected bandwidth \\ndemands, location (digital mapping), cost , and overall impact ; (b) incentives to the private sector to connect the identified \\ninstitutions through commercial tender ing; and (c) enhancement of government internet bandwidth through long -term \\nsupply agreements.   \\n  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 65 of 93  \\n     \\n20. The aim is to supply these government institutions with enhanced bandwidth by pre -purchasing bulk internet services \\nfrom the private sector, using competitive bidding, to be delivered at the desired locations . This way, government demand \\nas an anchor tenant for bandwidth is leveraged to encourage the private sector to invest in infrastructure in rural areas. \\nSpecific supported activities include: (a)  a feasibility study, conducted by a consulting firm who would be competitively \\nselected, to conduct a gap analysis covering bandwidth demand, location (digital mapping), likely costs , and overall impact \\nand (b) competitive tendering for internet bandwidth  on behalf of the government, through long -term supply agreements, \\nbased on IRU or ‘dark fiber ’. This mechanism has been used successfully in a number of other WBG projects, notably Digital \\nMalawi  Program Phase 1  (P160533), eTransform Ghana (P14414 0), and ICT Sector Support for Somalia  Phase II  (P152358). \\nOne obvious advantage is that it allows for the benefits of the project to continue beyond the closing date, as IRUs effectiv ely \\nallow for long -term leases of dark fiber.  \\n \\n2.2 Rural Broadband for Development  (US$ 29.5 million  equivalent ) \\n21. The aim of this sub -component is to significantly reduce Tanzania’s digital gap by providing universal connectivity access \\nin rural areas, digital underserved areas , and areas that would not otherwise be viable for mobile service providers to invest. \\nAs is the case in both developed and developing countries across the world, there are many areas with low population density \\nand/or very low average incomes in Tanzania t hat do not provide sufficient returns to drive affordable broadband services. \\nExpanding digital reach can among other things enhance access to markets and public digital services for rural populations \\nand strengthen climate resilience through early warning  solutions that can save lives and livelihoods.  This sub -component \\nwill build on the successful rural connectivity program under the RCIP -TZ, which b rought around  2.5 million people under \\nmobile signal coverage for the first time , to extend data -enabled ( 3G, 4G, or higher) network coverage to the three million \\nor so people currently living in areas that are unserved by any mobile cellular signal and through the upgrading of areas tha t \\ncurrently have only 2G networks to provide mobile broadband ( 3G, 4G, or higher). This will increase the volume of data usage \\nand hence encourage participation in digital economy development.  \\n \\n22. The primary mechanism to be used is the use of ‘reverse subsidy auctions ’ similar to that used under the RCIP -TZ and as \\nused in multiple W B projects,  such as Niger Smart Villages for Rural Growth and Digital Inclusion Project  (P167543) and Digital \\nMalawi (P160533). The UCSAF would designate geographical zones (in clusters or lots) where interested bidders (such as \\nmobile operators,  cell tower companies, high -altitude platform services , and so on ) would be invited to bid competitively for \\nthe lowest viable subsidy to CAPEX  that would be required for them to provide, or upgrade, service in the designated zones. \\nThus, IDA funding would  be alongside  funds from the UCSAF (using funds contributed to the USF) and would be used to \\nleverage investment from the private sector under a n MFD approach. Under the RCIP -TZ program, a contribution of \\nUS$30 million  from IDA leveraged private sector investment of around US$70  million .  \\n \\n23. As of mid -2020, through the UCSAF, the government has extended communication services in 703 wards having 2,530 \\nvillages with a population of more than 4 million people. This Rural Broadband for Development activity is intended to  \\nguarantee access to 3G or higher mobile broadband services  for more than 4  million  individuals . On July 18, 2019, the UCSAF \\nfloated the Rural Telecommunication Phase 4 tender to extend communication services in rural areas . This was funded using \\nthe UCSAF’s own resources, which is in turn  contributed under assessed cont ributions from public telecommunication \\noperators . However, the UCSAF’s funds are estimated to cover only around one quarter of the total requirement to achieve \\nuniversal service in Tanzania, which would cover 521 lots with 1,222 villages having at least 6 ,155,344 people.  Furthermore, \\nmany areas only have 2G capability at the moment and need to be upgraded to 3G and above to provide high -speed access \\nto broadband internet.  Therefore, it is hoped that the DTP will complement what the UCSAF  can mobilize from its own \\nresources , with further competitive tenders to be awarded using the reverse subsidy auction mechanism .  \\n \\n24. This activity will pilot the use of TVWS spectrum to connect underserved rural communities. This will enable the \\nutilization of an unused portion of spectrum allocated for television broadcasting in provision of broadband services in rura l  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 66 of 93  \\n     \\ncommunities. The pilot will be used to develop policy, guidelines , and regulations recommendations toward utilization of \\nunused spectrum to provide low -cost broadband services to rural communities.   \\n \\nComponent 3: Digital Platforms and Services  (US$ 47.8  million  equivalent ) \\n \\n25. The aim of this component is to build the core infrastructure and capacity necessary to support digital public service \\ndelivery, enhance the efficiency of the government’s internal operations , and roll  out priority digital productivity platforms \\nand public  services. Progress has been made in recent years in developing digital services and elements of a shared services \\nplatform (a mobile services portal, an SMS gateway, an e -payment gateway, and so on ), thereby strengthening the eGA and \\nfacilitating deployme nt of digital productivity tools for government. However, various MDAs and LGAs still operate stand -\\nalone IT systems and infrastructure and spend considerable financial and HR to develop, implement, and operate stand -alone \\ndigital services. This approach r isks creating cybersecurity vulnerabilities in non -standardized approaches . This also creates \\nsignificant financial, operational , and security liabilities for institutions which are ill -suited to cope with them. In addition, the \\ngovernment still lacks sufficient HR to meet increasing IT demands and adequate policies, practices , and an effective IT \\ninfrastructure to deploy high -quali ty digital services in a fast, secure, reliable , and cost -effective manner.  \\n \\n26. Increased access to affordable, high -quality connectivity will create an opportunity to enhance the way the government \\nconducts its business and provide s services to citizens usi ng digital technology. Offering public services through unified \\nmobile and online platforms can create significant benefits to citizens who must otherwise travel great distances and spend \\nsignificant time and resources to access services. This is particula rly important for Tanzania’s rural residents who may lack \\naccess to public transport and quality roads but are much more likely to have access to a mobile phone. Besides \\nsocioeconomic benefits , online services have a positive climate impact by reducing transport -related carbon emissions to \\naccess public offices, particularly for those government offices in rural areas which are being provided with enhanced \\nbandwidth under the project. In additio n, digital platforms offer opportunities to deliver new categories of services and \\ntransactions such as digital cash transfers under social protection or payroll schemes, lower administrative and logistical \\nbarriers to service delivery, deliver information  on natural disasters and early warning systems to enhance climate resilience, \\nand reduce scope for corruption. This component will include the following sub -components . \\n \\n3.1 Digital Services and Productivity Platforms  (US$ 29.5  million  equivalent ) \\n \\na) One Stop Service Centers ( OSSCs) -- Huduma Jamii  Cent ers (US$ 21.5  million  equivalent ) \\n \\n27. With the advent of the digital age, the service delivery framework needs to be re -engineered to include new tools and \\nprocesses. There is also a need to improve existing processes and procedures for offering services to citizens. This could be \\nachieved by establishing OSSC s where services can be accessed in a simple, speedy , secure , and seamless manner.  \\n \\n28. This activity therefore aims to establish OSSC s at central  and local government service delivery points , allowing citizens \\naccess to various government services from a single location. The OSSC s, which are referred to in Swahili language as Huduma \\nJamii , will be a key platform for public service delivery and collection and payments of various fees, taxes , and levies that \\ncitizens and businesses pay to the government through the GePG and other platforms. An objective when designing the \\nOSSCs will be ensuring physical accessibility for disabled people, as well as exploring the opportunity to tailor digital  services \\nto specials needs of vulnerable persons . This could include  low-cost ‘web  text to voice’ services for visually impaired users. \\nTasks to be implemented under this activity include a design review for the integration of service delivery plat forms; capacity \\nbuilding ; a revision of legal frameworks; public awareness campaigns; rehabilitation or re furbishment of existing \\ninfrastructure; construction of last -mile connectivity and interconnection with back -end systems of service delivery; purchase \\nof ICT equipment; establishment of procedures and processes for OSSC operations; and undertaking of supervision and M&E   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 67 of 93  \\n     \\nof OSSC performance . \\n \\n29. The OSSCs will be established with various ICT infrastructure and equipm ent, including ICT application systems, a \\npayment gateway, a queuing system, a secured network, telecommunications equipment, and a call center. Measures would \\nbe put in place to maximize the protection of private data entered, uploaded , and processed at t he OSSCs or on their servers \\nfrom hacks, breaches , or accidental exposure. Furthermore, a n OSSC management structure will be established and will \\ninclude representation of various government service providers to facilitate provision of services in an effec tive and efficient \\nmanner. The activity aims to establish up to 31 OSSCs over four phases, however the number of centers may change \\ndepending on the outcome of the experience with implementing the early phases.    \\n \\nb) Digital  Economy (US$ 8.0 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n30. This activity intends to address the digital economy aspect in public FM. In the digital era, the traditional economy is \\ntransformed by the application of digital services which simplify ways of doing work by having accessible, reliable , and s ecure \\nservices. It is characterized by greater digital connectivity, digital financial inclusion, skilled labor , and mainstreaming  of the \\noperational technologies. This activity will focus on enhancement of the financial/payment systems by updating rules and \\nregulation pertaining to digital financial transactions, that is, the mobile financial technologies, banking systems, operato rs, \\nand regulator of the financial industry (BoT), and enhancement of the NPS. Regulations, standards , and guidelines on \\nrecognized international practices for the protection of digital payments systems and digital financial services from \\ncybercrime will be adopted, as will measures to protect the privacy of personal data in compliance with forthcoming \\nlegislation. Additiona lly, the activity will contribute to increasing revenue for the government and increasing the number of \\nplayers in the Financial Technology ( FinTech ) market by having in place skills and systems that address areas that are not well \\nserved by the current ec onomy. This will not only increase the revenue but also the contribution of the ICT sector to the \\neconomy and economic growth of the country. The activity will be implemented under the guidance of the M CIT.  \\n \\n31. A scoping study will be carried out to identify  key areas for improvement , especially around financial regulations, \\ntechnical capacity among staff, and sector readiness that  enables the digital economy.   \\n \\n 3.2  Internet Data Cent er Infrastructure  (US$1 3.2 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n32. The expected growth in the digital economy will require robust government data infrastructure. The Government has \\nadopted a government -wide approach to data infrastructure and is consolidating all government server rooms and Network \\nOperations Centers (NOCs) into a standardized government cloud infrastructure. It is projected that this investment will \\nsupport the growth of government ICT business operations over the next 5 to 10 years. Therefore, e nhancing the data center \\ninfrastructure by acquiring storage, networking equipment , and computing resources for the government shared platform \\nwill enable cost -effective sharing of resources, increase reliability and security  of electronic services offered by the \\ngovernment, enhance storage of government data , as well as creat e efficiency in sharing and accessing government \\napplications through the shared infrastructure. As opposed to operating multiple siloed systems, resource sharing among \\ngovernment entities will also help reduce energy consumption. Besides this efficiency ga in, considerations related to data \\ncenter energy efficiency will be considered when expanding data center capacity ( for example , use of renewables). In \\naddition , when expanding data center infrastructure , climate risks will be tak en into consideration, inc luding robustness, \\nback -up strategies, discontinuity plans , and training of staff on these.   \\n \\n33. The shared infrastructure will be hosted in the existing National Data Centers.  Project financing will be used to \\nstrengthen the support environment for the data center and the installation of additional ICT hardware (computer, storage , \\nand networking equipment) and software tools for the shared computing infrastructure in the existing data centers. The  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 68 of 93  \\n     \\ncybersecurity and physical security of the NDC  and its infrastructure will be assessed at baseline and via regular risk analyses \\nand penetration tests throughout the lifetime of the project, with the recommendations to address vulnerabilities of the \\nfacilities supported under the project. Implementation will take energy efficiency into account and ensure data centers are \\nresilient toward weather -induced risk that will increase with changing climate patterns. To realize the full benefits of data \\ncenter a nd cloud innovation, it is essential to be able to deploy e -services rapidly and securely. This sub -component will be \\nimplemented by enhancing existing data center infrastructure.  \\n \\n3.3.  Digital Literacy and Capacity Building (US$ 5.1 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n34. The GoT has long recognized the importance of adopting ICTs  to improve business processes in public institutions to \\nensure quality as well as effective and efficient delivery of services to its citizens. In  this regard significant progress in \\ndeployment and use of ICT -enabled systems in public service delivery has been made. A number of ICT systems and \\napplications to support the execution of government functions and provision of government services to citizens (G2C), \\nbusinesses (G2B), between public institutions (G2G) , and public employees (G2E) have been implemented in different areas.  \\n \\n35. To ensure that the existing e -services  are well supported, promoted , and utilized by consumers (citizens, businesses , \\nand other stakeholders at large), the government intends to build the capacity of the ICT cadre for managing and supporting \\nexisting government ICT Systems (supply side). It also plans to implement a promot ional and awareness program on the \\nservices available, where they can be accessed, and how they can be utilized (demand side). This activity will also address \\nissues of web  accessibility for the elderly and disabled citizens, including best practice on int erface design and user  agents. \\nThe awareness program aims to improve accessing and using e -services provided by public institutions.  \\n \\na)    Government  ICT Cadre Training Program  (US$ 4.6 million  equivalent ) \\n \\n36. This activity  is intended to address recommendations presented following an ICT skills gap assessment conducted in all \\nministries in 2018. The objective of the assessment was to assess existing ICT skills and identify skills gap in the ministri es, so \\nthat proper strate gies could be implemented to address the gap. Results showed that only 39  percent  had expert -level skills \\nand the remaining 61  percent  had average ICT skills, where some were able to  provide delivery of ICT services and support, \\nbut most lacked the specialized skills required to develop and support ICT products. Greater technical skills are needed to \\naddress this deficiency , with a particular emphasis on improving the provision of skil ls training for women .  \\n \\n37. The project covers training of specialized ICT skills for up to 500 ICT experts from the ministries , with a balance between \\nmen and women . This will also include long courses at the level of master\\'s degrees in specialized universi ties worldwide, \\nwhereas the project is intending to train in technical skills especially in emerging technologies and areas of need and that \\naddresses government focuses on digital economy and industrialization. Recognized industry certifications, for inst ance for \\ncybersecurity, for government IT officials to be able to capably serve as CSIOs of their agencies will also be supported . Having  \\nICT professionals capable of developing and supporting government ICT systems will be of great benefit.  \\n \\n38. The estimated cost for master’s degree training in specialized universities ranges from US $70,000 to US$100,000 per \\nperson, allowing  about  50 individuals to  be trained to acquire ICT skills (such as Artificial Intelligence  [AI], Internet of Things , \\ncybersecuri ty, and other emerging technologies) with a budget of US $3.5 million . In addition to master\\'s degrees, a further \\nUS$1.1  million  is allocated to train 450 specialized ICT professionals from the MDAs and LGAs in specialized areas based on \\nexisting gaps in sh ort courses. This training will include sensitization on issues o f usability and accessibility of public platforms, \\nincluding for disabled groups, as well as education on issues related to sustainable digitization, including e -waste handling \\nand energy efficiency .   \\n  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 69 of 93  \\n     \\n \\nb)  Citizen  Digital Literacy  (US$ 0.5 million  equivalent ) \\n39. The awareness programming intended  to be carried out  includes, but is not limited to, e -Government services, social \\nmedia, TV , and radio programming; TV adverts and short video clips; print media campaign; dissemination of publicity \\nmaterials; and workshops and seminars (for media  and the public). Additiona lly, digital fora, conferences, exhibitions , and \\nyouth -focused digital competitions to encourage innovation will be supported. This programming will support all activities in \\nthe project. It will also include campaigns directed to the public about the prot ection of personal data in government services \\nand the rights of individuals to determine use of their personal data. Anticipated benefits include:  \\ni. Increased levels of awareness among  citizens, businesses , and other consumers of government e -services . \\nii. Increased usage of the public digital services  and adherence to legal and regulatory frameworks . \\niii. Feedback on services currently provided by public institutions . \\niv. Establishment of a forum to discuss key issues a nd potential solutions for emerging issues in the provision of \\ndigital government services . \\nv. Increased awareness and participation  of women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics ( STEM ) \\nprograms and more broadly in ICT.  \\n \\n40. The total estimated budget for this activity is US$100,000 per year, amounting to US $500,000 over five years.   \\n \\n41. Planned project activities are completed by a project management component  (US$3.5 million) and an unalloc ated \\ncontingency fund (US$7.5 million).  The PIU , established under component 4,  will comprise an overall project coordinator, a \\ndigital government services specialist, an ICT technical specialist/ TA officer , and specialists in procurement and financial \\nmanagement  (FM)  as well as safeguards specialists.

Mobile internet is widely used in developing countries around the world as a substitute for, and complement to, \\nwired internet connections. Deployment can be quicker, with costs generally being cheaper for wireless networks , and \\nadvance payment models suit the economic circumstances of low -income nations. Tanzania is no exception ; mobile \\nwireless internet subscriptions grew from 4 million in 2011 to 25 million in 2019 (   Figure  4). By contrast, wired broadband \\n(for example , Digital Subscriber Line [DSL] technology, and fiber -optic connections) in the country account for fewer \\nthan 5 percent of internet subscriptions.   \\n \\n  Figure 4: Mobile wireless internet users, Tanzania  \\n  \\nNote : Population figures for calculating ‘per 100 people ’ from World Bank. Though the figure for mobile wireless internet \\nusers is published by the TCRA as ‘users ’ they appear to refer to subscriptions. Given the difficulty of identifying broadband \\nusers (due to different handset capabilities and coverage zones) , there are no official figures reported for mobile broadband.  \\nSource : TCRA Quarterly Communications Stat istics Report . \\n \\n2. Despite the growth, there is considerable potential for further expansion of wireless internet in Tanzania. Two of \\nthe main drivers of wireless internet take -up are coverage and affordability. Tanzania is not performing as well in these \\nmetrics in comparison to other East African peers such as Kenya and Rwanda  (figure 5) .

DTP will create favorable conditions that should result in a sharp boost to the country\\'s mobile internet \\npenetration. Sub -component 1.1: Digital Enabling Environment and Sub -component 2.2: Rural Broadband for \\nDevelopment will lead to greater sector liberaliz ation and improved rural connectivity. This should result in lower prices \\nand expanded coverage, though perhaps not comparable with the spectacular gains made under the RCIP -TZ, as the \\ncountry is now starting from a much higher base of subscribers. These f actors should result in Tanzania reaching the \\nlevel of East African peers in mobile internet subscription penetration (the average figure for Kenya and Rwanda was 70  \\npercent  in 2019).  \\n \\n4. Tanzania\\'s wireless internet subscriptions are based on (a) its curr ent trajectory and (b) reaching the level of East \\nAfrican peers over the period 2020 –2028, as shown in figure 6.35  \\n \\n \\n \\n34 Data for Kenya and Rwanda from ICT sector regulators (https://ca.go.ke/consumers/industry -research -statistics/statistics/ and \\nhttps://rura.rw/index.php?id=194).  \\n35 Figures for Tanzania’s mobile internet subscriptions without Digital Tanzania are based on forecasts from one of the country\\'s mobile \\noperators.

Increased mobile broadband penetration has both direct and indirect impacts. Direct impacts will accrue from a \\ngrowing ICT sector , particularly the spill -over into computer and information services as applications and data storage \\nand processing  facilities are developed to leverage the increased connectivity (for instance, under sub-component 3.2).  \\n \\n6. Indirect benefits accrue from increased connectivity across different economic sectors. Enterprise productivity is \\nenhanced, thereby boosting gro wth. New opportunities are created for digital businesses ( Sub-component 1.1). \\nNumerous studies have quantified the indirect impact of broadband on the economy. An analysis conducted for the \\nWorld Bank found that each 10-percentage point increase in mobile  broadband penetration increases annual GDP per \\ncapita growth by between 0.48 and 0.60 percentage points.36  \\n \\n7. The indirect economic impact of the DTP can be calculated using the midpoint of the values for the percentage \\npoint increase in GDP per capita (0.54=(0.48+0.60 )/2). The base forecast for GDP growth is contrasted with the GDP \\nimpact from DTP (Table 11). By the end of the period, it is estimated that that DTP will have raised the expected \\npenetration rate of mobile broadband by about 9 percentage points. The impact on GDP will be worth about US$47.7  \\nmillion  (NPV) cumulative, over the period t ill 2028, with  further gains thereafter. However, the ma in benefits of this \\ninvestment will be evident in the social and regional allocation of increased growth, which will be focused under sub-\\ncomponent 2.2 on the poorest rural areas.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n36 World Bank. 2017.

Sub-component 2.1: Enhancement of Government ICT Connectivity  and Component 3: Digital Platforms and \\nServices of the project feature activities aimed at the productive use of ICT in government. The application of ICT for \\ngovernment services increases efficiency and lowers costs. Citizens also benefit from less time spent travelling to \\ngovernment offices and waiting in line. Several research studies from South Asia corroborate these be nefits for citizens. \\nA study examining the effect of the introduction of different public e -services in India found that the number of trips and \\nwaiting times were lowered for users.37 An evaluation following the introduction of a computerized vehicle regi stration \\nsystem in Bhutan found that although the short term costs to implement the system rose, users reported greater \\nefficiency and transparency.38 Data from Sri Lanka concretely illustrates the benefits for citizens. The introduction of e -\\nservices drov e a reduction in the time users spend to obtain a public service from 371 minutes in 2011 to 124 minutes \\nin 2013.39 The average amount spent by citizens obtaining a public service before the introduction of e -services in 2011 \\nwas LKR 1,553 (US$13.74) or 0. 31 percent  of average annual household expenditure.40 The cost includes travel, \\nopportunity cost, service fees, food, accommodation , and any other costs associated with obtaining a public service. By \\n2013, this figure had dropped to LKR 747 (US$5.79) or 0. 15 percent  of average annual household expenditure, an annual \\naverage reduction of 22  percent . \\n \\n37 Bhatnagar, Subhash C., and Nupur Singh. 2010. \"Assessing the Impact of E -government: A Study of Projects in India.\" Information Technologies \\n& International Development .https://itidjournal.org/index.php/itid/article/download/523/523 -1394 -2-PB.pdf  \\n38 Miyata, Mayumi. 2011. \"Measuring Impacts of e -Government Support in Least Developed Countries: A Case Study of the Vehicle Registration \\nService in Bhutan.\" Information Technology for Development . https://ict4dblog.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/miyata11 -egovbhutan.pdf.  \\n39 ICTA (Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka). 2013.

Determining the potential impact of improved public services in Tanzania is difficult given the lack of information \\nabout the time and costs citizens incur to  carry out government transactions. A 2014 survey found that over half of \\nTanzanian internet users utilized the internet to get information about government or public services, equivalent to 10 \\npercent of the population.41 However, the wording is vague abo ut the scope and could range from simply using the \\ninternet to find a government phone number to actually carrying out some degree of a transaction. Nevertheless, it \\nindicates that already there is familiarity with the concept of e -services among some citi zens in the country.  \\n \\n10. The possible benefit to Tanzanian citizens of online services is estimated based on the findings from the Sri Lanka \\nstudy.42 The cost of obtaining a public service on site includes travel, opportunity cost, service fees, food , and \\naccommodation. If the same pre e -services ratio in Sri Lanka (0.31  percent  of household expenditure) is applied to \\nTanzania, it results in a public s ervice spend of US$6.85 per household per transaction.43 Assuming Tanzania achieves \\nthe same cost reduction as Sri Lanka (22  percent  a year) due to DTP, the benefit to citizens is shown in  table 1 2. The \\ntable  compares the case where there is no change to t he cost of a public service compared to the fall in cost due to the \\nintroduction of e -services, assuming that by year 10 50 percent  of households would use e -services. The table shows the \\nreduction in the cost of obtaining three government services per yea r over 10 years with total savings amounting to \\nUS$190 million (NPV).44  \\n \\nTable 12: Savings to citizens from reduced transactions costs resulting from Digital Tanzania  Project  \\nYear    US$, millions  \\nCost of e -service  \\n(US$)  % of households \\nusing e-services  No e -services  \\n(US$)  With e -services  \\n(US$)  Difference  (US$)  \\n2021 6.85      \\n2022 6.32  5 13 12 1 \\n2023 5.83  7 17 14 2 \\n2024 5.38  9 22 18 5 \\n2025 4.96  12 30 22 8 \\n2026 4.58  16 40 27 13 \\n2027 4.22  21 53 33 20 \\n2028 3.90  28 71 40 31 \\n2029 3.59  37 94 49 45 \\n2030  3.32  50 126 61 65 \\n  Cumulative    190 \\n     NPV   70 \\n Note:  Assumes three government transactions per year.

Shared services across public institutions and \\nautomated processes for government operations will increase productivity and efficiency. The ability to deliver online \\nservices to citizens will reduce costs compared to face -to-face meetings. One study on the cost savings from e -\\nGovernment is an analysis for Australia finding that public services delivered online cost significantly less than those with \\na physical face -to-face interaction.45 The co st per transaction was found to be A$16.90 (US$12.58) when face -to-face \\ncompared to A$0.40 (US$0.30) online. Extrapolating data from the Australian experience to Tanzania and adjusting for \\nincome differences leads to the following generalized assumptions:  \\n• On average, there are 34 government transactions per person in Australia. Applying this to Tanzania results \\nin an estimated 1.9 billion government transactions per year.  \\n• The cost of a face -to-face transaction in Australia, presumably mainly labor costs, i s adjusted by using the \\nratio of Australia\\'s GDP per capita ( in purchasing power parities ) to Tanzania\\'s. This results in face -to-face \\ncost per transaction in Tanzania of US$0.64. No change is made to the average cost of an online transaction \\n(US$0.30) sin ce this mainly results from computerization, a cost assumed roughly similar in Australia and \\nTanzania.  \\n• It is estimated that presently 5  percent  of government transactions are carried out online in Tanzania, a figure \\nthat will rise to 30  percent  after 10 years due to Digital Tanzania. In Australia, 60  percent  of government \\ntransactions were carried out online in 2015.  \\n12. Based on these assumptions, it is estimated that the savings to the GoT from moving a quarter of all transactions \\nfrom offline to online in 10 years would be US$341 million (NPV). These savings, equivalent to 12  percent  of GoT’s  \\nexpenses for 2018 and equal to 0.5  percent  of its 2019 GDP, accrues from a reduction of just US$0. 34 per transaction. \\nThese are remarkable potential savings, but it should be noted than most will accrue in the later phases of the program, \\nwhen the emphasis on eGovernment applications, rather than connectivity on enabling environment, is greater. The \\nAustralian study also calculated savings to citizens from online public services to be 0.8  percent  of household \\nconsumption expenditure. Applying that figure to Tanzania results in a citizen savings of US$24 million a year, roughly \\nequivalent to the US$19 million a year in the citizens savings example above based on a different set of assumptions.  \\n \\nTable 13: Estimated costs savings from moving government transactions from offline to online  \\nas a result of Digital Tanzania  Project  \\nYear  No change  \\n(US$)  Face -to-Face  (US$)  Online  (US$)  Total  (US$)  Savings  \\n(US$)  Online \\nshare  (%) \\n0  1,100  1,073.2  26.3  1,100    5 \\n1  1,100  1,041  41 1,082   17  8 \\n2  1,100  1,010  56 1,066   34  11 \\n3  1,100  979 70 1,049  50  13 \\n4  1,100  950 84 1,034  66  16 \\n5  1,100  921 97 1,018   81  18 \\n6  1,100  893 110 1,004  96  21 \\n7  1,100  867 123 989  110  23 \\n8  1,100  841 135 975  124  26 \\n9  1,100  815 147 962  138  28 \\n10  1,100  791 158 949  151  30 \\n \\n45 Deloitte. 2015.

These estimates indicate that the modest investment in the DT P (US$150  million ) would be repaid many times \\nover from potential cost savings and from the cumulative boost to economic growth of over US$1.1 b illion over 10 years, \\nor around  US$433  million  using NPV. Furthermore, this calculation does not take into account savings and economic \\nboost from other part s of the program, such as the stimulus to e -Commerce (in sub-component 1.2) or the benefits from \\nbetter trained civil servants (under sub-component 3.3).

Tanzania is experiencing challenges related to climate change,  including unpredictable rainfall, rising \\ntemperatures , and sea levels, and an increase in extreme weather events. These changes are predicted to worsen in the \\ncoming years and will threaten livelihoods, in frastructure , and public health, among other adverse effects.  \\n2. The project has been screened for Climate and Disaster Risk,  using the World Bank Risk Screening Assessment \\nTool. Tanzania’s future exposure to relevant climate and geophysical hazards is consi dered substantial while the current \\nlevel of exposure is moderate. In particular, Tanzania  is at high risk of rising sea  levels and adverse weather. The following \\nhighlights key risk s and their linkages to the project.  \\n3. Extreme temperature . Monthly minimum and maximum temperatures increased between 1974 and 2004 at the \\nmeteorological stations located  in the regions of Arusha, Bukoba, Dodoma, Iringa, Kilimanjaro, Mbeya, Morogoro, \\nMwanza, Songea, Tanga, and  Shinyanga in Tanzania. Average annual tempera ture is projected to increase by 1.0° to 2.7° \\nC by  2060.  It is expected that the project will include activities in  these regions . Extreme temperatures can put additional \\npressure on data centers and other infrastructure installations.   \\n4. Extreme precipitat ion, flooding , and landslides . Rainfall over Tanzania has become more variable. One of the \\nmain reason s for decreased precipitation  and increased flooding is related to a reduction in forest cover . Future  floods \\nare the main natural hazard that Tanzania ex periences on a regular basis. Heavy precipitation is projected to  increase \\nover East Africa, including Tanzania . Increased heavy rainfall due to climate change may lead to malfunctioning and \\ndisruption of critical infrastructures, including communications facilities and data centers , through soil erosion, \\nwaterlogging, and flooding. However, in general project installations such as cell towers are in higher lying areas which \\nare less prone to flooding.  \\n5. Sea level rise. Sea level rise has affected  the coast of Tanzania , notably  in the district of Bagamoyo in recent years. \\nThe key structural measures of the DTP are distributed nationwide , with few in coastal areas or in Zanzibar, and are \\ngenerally  far above the sea level . They  are hence unlikely to be ex posed to a sea level rise.  \\nClimate related project activities  \\n6. The project  aims to systematically improve climate resilience in Tanzania through a program of activities that cover  \\nboth climate adaptation and mitigation.    \\nClimate adaptation   \\n• Policy scan to identify laws or gaps that tackle climate -friendly digitization.  \\n• Capacity building for government officials to design and implement climate -resilient communications \\ninfrastructure , and to design and implement disaster risk plans, including backup and data loss contingencies . \\n• Integration of topics related to climate -friendly connectivity and digital consumption, including e -waste \\nmanagement and energy efficiency in training activities .  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 84 \\n     \\n \\n• Extended coverage and services of broadband internet to remote areas will enable the creation of climate early \\nwarning and emergency  response  systems through the  uninterrupted  network available in the aftermath of a \\ndisaster .   \\n• Technology choices for infras tructure will, when possible, take climate resilience into account. For example , \\noperators of cell towers in rural areas will be required to increase climate resilience by choosing sites which \\nare not subject to flooding.  \\n• To the extent possible , underground deployment of fiber cables, as opposed to , for example, aerial cables, will \\nbe prioritized, as these are more likely to be water  resistant and tend to be more robust.   \\n \\nClimate mitigation  \\n \\n• Refurbishment of computers will prolong the lifetime of computers and reduce e -waste and subsequently \\nemissions related to production of devices.  \\n• Increased use of digital technologies to substitute for physical movement of goods and people can reduc e GHG \\nemissions. In particular, the focus on last -mile connectivity  and O SSCs would reduce the need of rural citizens \\nto travel to government office s.  \\n• Technology choices for infrastructure will, when possible, take climate mitigation into account ; for exam ple, \\nenergy -efficient data centers.    \\n \\n   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 85 \\n     \\n \\nANNEX 6: World Bank Group COVID -19 Country Program Response Note – Tanzania  \\nCOUNTRY: Tanzania   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  \\n1. Health impact. A full assessment of the COVID -19 health situation in Tanzania has proven to be difficult. Tanzania \\nreported its first COVID -19 case on March 16, 2020, and as of April 29, 2020, the last date on which data was published, \\nrecorded a total of 509 cases with 21 deaths. Tanzania, as almost all countries in Africa, appears to have lower morbidity \\nand mortality than the global trend, including Europe and North America. Anecdotal evidence indicates COVID -19 cases \\nand deaths persist, but the numbers continue to be low despite lifting of most restrictions. The Government has been \\nadvised by the WHO, UNICEF , and various development partners , including the World Bank , to continue tracking and \\nensure timely reporting of COVID -19-related information on new infections and  deaths, to ensure interventions are \\nadapted to the epidemiological trends.  \\n \\n2. Economic impact . Tanzania’s solid macroeconomic performance over the past six years is being put to the test by \\nthe COVID -19 pandemic. COVID -19 has slowed the Tanzanian economy, particularly in tourism and other externally \\nlinked sectors including transport and manufactur ing. Additionally, leading indicators of private consumption and private \\ninvestment ( for example , domestic credit growth, tax revenues, import of capital goods) show a deceleration. According \\nto World Bank estimates, growth is projected to decelerate from an estimated 5.8 percent in 2019 to 2.5 percent in \\n2020, with an expected rebound near 6 percent over the medium  term. Declining economic activity has held inflation in \\ncheck, at 3.1 percent year -on-year in October 2020 , and is projected to remain stable. A major decline in imports plus \\nbuoyant exports of gold and traditional products offset the decline in exports of manufactured goods and services \\n(tourism), with the current account on balance declining to 1 percent of GDP in September 2020 from 2.8 percen t a year \\nearlier. Official gross reserves have declined but remain adequate to cover six months of projected imports of goods and \\nservices, and the Tanzanian shilling has remained relatively stable against the currencies of major trading partners.  \\n \\n3. Distributional impact . The poverty impact of COVID -19 is considerable, albeit less severe than in other countries. \\nCell phone location data suggests that in Tanzania reductions in people’s mobility were more moderate than in other \\nSub-Saharan African countries . However, 14 percent of businesses had laid off  workers , and around 8 percent of workers \\nhave lost their job, according to a recent enterprise phone survey. With one quarter of the poor relying on the non -farm \\nsector for their income, poverty is likely to  increase by 1 –2 percent in 2020.    \\n4. Government response. Tanzania’s COVID -19 response at the onset of the crisis was reasonably robust. The \\ncountry implemented critical mitigation measures to limit the spread of the virus without national lockdown and \\nenhanced its preparedness/containment capacity. The GoT established three coordi nation committees to oversee the \\nresponse at the country level. It also initiated detection and surveillance at points of entry, including at airports and \\nborder crossings; closed schools and airports; suspended public meetings, sporting , and social events  and international \\npassenger flights; encouraged people to avoid unnecessary movements, practice hand hygiene and social distancing; \\nand designated public and private hospitals to serve as COVID -19 treatment centers. In addition, the GoT operationalized \\ncontact tracing, quarantining of contacts in designated places, and strengthened laboratory capacity to collect samples \\nand test for COVID -19. A National Response Plan for COVID -19 was developed, aligned with the WHO’s COVID -19 Global \\nStrategic Preparedness and Response Plan. It mobilized support from development partners, primarily grant financing \\nof US$68 million. The restrictive measures were eased from May 2020 as the government claimed a drastic drop in \\nCOVID -19 infections.  \\n \\n5. Participation in the DSSI . A preliminary Debt Sustainability Analysis update (April 2020) indicates that Tanzania \\nremains at low risk of debt distress. Official bilateral and multilateral creditors continue to be the major financiers.  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 86 \\n     \\n \\nTanzania is participating in the COVID -19 Debt  Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) of the G20, which should free about \\nUS$148.9  million  (0.2 percent of 2019 GDP).  \\n \\n6. WBG Response. The Government has not sought financing from the WBG’s COVID -19 Multi -phase Programmatic \\nApproach ( MPA ). The WB COVID -19 support has primarily been through: (a) the US$3.79 million COVID -19 Pandemic \\nEmergency Financing Facility Project (P174366), to streng then capacity for laboratory diagnosis and management of \\nCOVID -19 cases, financed under the Pandemic Emergency Financing Facility and (b) the Strengthening Primary Health \\nCare for Results Program (P152736). The WB is a contributor to the Health Basket Fund  which has provided US$6.5 \\nmillion to support provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) to primary health care facilities nationwide. In \\naddition, the Tanzania Urban Resilience Program (P159779) has supported promoting risk awareness in urban areas \\nthrough an Information, Education and Communication package, including animated videos and posters carrying \\nmessages on COVID -19. The WBG, in coordination with participating development partners, agreed to temporarily \\nsuspend the health and education condi tionalities linked to the payment of cash transfers for poor households beyond \\nsupporting, on an exceptional basis, a double payment for Productive Social Safety Net Project (P165648) beneficiaries, \\nto provide them with an extra buffer during a time of cri sis. In addition, the Bank has provided analytical input to support \\nthe GoT’s pandemic response, including a note outlining the impact of COVID -19 from a social protection perspective, \\nwith policy options designed to protect poor and vulnerable households.   \\n \\n7. All projects’ Implementation Status and Results Reports (ISRs) include a consideration of impacts of COVID -19, \\nand all pipelined operations, additional financing , and restructurings are being screened for potential COVID -19 response \\nfocus. At the same time, the WB is leveraging its Advisory Services and Analytics ( ASA) portfolio to strengthen the \\nevidence base to inform COVID -19 sensitivity in development programmi ng, including the forthcoming Performance and \\nLearning Review (PLR) for the Tanzania CPF .   \\n \\n8. Vaccination . Tanzania  is eligible  for the COVAX  Facility,  a global  effort  aimed  at delivering  COVID - 19 vaccines to low - \\nand middle -income countries. The GoT is yet to apply for accessing this Facility which is advised by the technical agencies \\n(WHO and UNICEF) who also call for the adoption of international standard responses, including COVID -19 vaccine \\ndeployment targeting high risk groups ( including frontlin e health care workers; and people above the age of 65 and \\nthose with  comorbidities). The GoT has established a Technical Committee to assess the effectiveness of available \\nvaccines with the view to recommending the most viable option . \\n9. Use of IDA19 resources . Tanzania’s indicative IDA19 national allocation  is around US$2 billion. The WB will ensure \\nthat projects financed under Tanzania’s IDA19 country allocation are well aligned with both the objectives of the CPF \\n(FY18 /19–22/23) and key IDA19 priori ties, including a strong focus on human capital and infrastructure that directly \\nbenefits the poorest. Tanzania could avail itself of financing available under the COVID -19 MPA for COVID -19 vaccination, \\nhowever , at present has not yet indicated interest in  MPA financing for vaccination.  \\n \\n10. Development partners.  A range of donors are supporting the Government’s response plan. Donor financing \\nincludes the IMF ( US$14.3 million under Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust), the Arab Bank for Economic \\nDevelopment in Africa ( US$1.7 million), the European Union ( US$44.2 million), Republic of  Korea ( US$0.5 million), and \\nthe Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria ( US$6.2 million), along with others ( US$1.5 million).  \\n \\n \\n \\n  The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 87 \\n     \\n \\nTable 14: Tanzania: FY21 indicative lending and restructuring program ( as of February 25, 2021)  \\n \\nCPF Focus  Relief  Restructuring  Resilient Recovery  \\nEnhance productivity and \\naccelerate equitable and \\nsustainable growth     \\nBoost human capital and social \\ninclusion  US$3.79  million Tanzania COVID -19 \\nPandemic Emergency Financing \\nFacility Project (P174366)    \\nModernize and improve the \\nefficiency of public institutions     \\n \\n   The World Bank   \\nDigital Tanzania Project  (P160766 ) \\n \\n \\n  \\n Page 88 \\n     \\n \\nANNEX 7: Identification of gender barriers and opportunities and targeted action s \\nCOUNTRY: Tanzania   \\nDigital Tanzania Project   \\n1.
